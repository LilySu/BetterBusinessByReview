I just love little cafe.

Los Cafetaleros Coffee Roastery uses their own roasted beans making a wicked cortadito ($2.50), rich and aromatic. 

Americano ($2.25) single shot though a little weak, please let the barista know not to add too much water.

Love the armchairs facing College Street as my Yelp friend feels like one of those retired Portuguese men.

$10/lb for any beans till the end of October. And of course I could not resist a bargain.

The owner is passionate about coffee and knowledgeable about their beans and products.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

It is located just a block down from the Asian mall on the corner of 16th and Centre, and is just off of Centre Street. The entrance to the place is actually located on the other side, in the parking lot! I was taken here my first time, otherwise I never would have found it.

It is small and dinky and more than a little wonderful. The service is good, the food is good, and the atmosphere which makes it feel almost like a cafeteria is a little refreshing. It feels authentic, which I like. 

I'm partial to their springrolls (which come cheap) and the giant crispy egg noodle dish that they have which is just delicious. I always end up splitting it or taking half of it home. The Pho is also tasty and delicious, and very slurpable. They use quality beef which I like.

When I was here recently, I decided to vary from the selection of sweet dessert like drinks that they had on order. The three bean soy drink is filling and delicious, the aloe drink refreshing, and the coke with real lime juice is very sweet. I just wanted water... with some lemon. After finally explaining sufficiently (it took a little while) to the gentleman who I think is the owner, I received my water... and beside it, a little dish with two limes! Haha, it was totally cute and endeared them to me forever.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

My mom learned of the cafe through living social so we decided to dine here for lunch on a weekday.  We had a wonderful experience overall! The interior is very cute and the bar is beautiful. After a long time of deliberating because the entire menu looked delicious, we ordered our grilled portobello sandwiches and looked around in the cute little shop attached to the cafe while we were waiting for our food.  Before we knew it, our food was ready and the sandwiches did not disappoint! Although I loved what I ordered, next time I think I will have to try one of their salads.  They all sounded so fresh and tasty! Not only were the food, the service, and the atmosphere all on point, but the prices were also pretty reasonable for the quality.

Nice to go out to eat and be able to choose from anything on the menu, rather than find the one vegetarian thing on the menu.

My husband had been here for lunch, but for some reason it just hadn't made it on to our dinner circuit yet. So glad we made it, because we'll definitely be frequent patrons now!

I have a hard time describing the decor inside, but it was perfect.... clean looking, modern paint and decor.... just a very nice ambiance, jazz playing, & nice lighting. We went in on a Saturday night around 5pm, and there was a table of six already there, and another couple came in later. I like that it was NOT loud, busy and crazy in this restaurant. So relaxing, and calm. 

Our waiter was friendly. I can agree with other reviews that said the service was slow, so I wouldn't go if you are in a rush. My husband said he went on lunch break once and was 45 minutes late getting back to work. The service wasn't that slow when we were there, but it definitely wasn't speedy. This isn't something I mind though. It was more of a chance to enjoy the environment, and spend time talking.

Our food was pretty amazing, and the portion sizes were big. We started baked brie. This was seasonally done, with cinnamon, clove and apple. This was my favorite part of the meal! So delish. For entrees, I had the perogie lasagna and my husband had the quiche. After such a large appetizer, I was only able to eat half of my entree but my husband still had room to devour his entire plate. Perogie lasagna was gooey, hot and definitly a winter comfort food.  I noticed on the menu online perogie lasagna isn't listed... so maybe they change things up slightly for the seasons? 

I think anyone could find something they like on the menu really. It's worth the drive if you want to find someplace new to eat. It's definitely worth checking out if you are already in the Waterfront and don't want to eat at a big chain restaurant.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

I recently just stopped eating meat, so this was perfect.  There were so many delicious things to choose from on the menu.  I ordered the fried egg sandwich, which came on home made bread (light and crusty, delicious) with provolone and arugula and home fries (potatoes, a little spicy, but tasty).  My friend ordered the breakfast burrito which came stuffed with cheddar cheese, some type of chili and home fries.  She said that it was also a little spicy.  

Our check came with chocolate covered coffee beans, how cute.

Can't wait to go back for lunch or dinner! 

I agree with the other reviews, it does take a while before the food arrives.  There were only 2 other tables with people.  However, I think that goes with the feel of the cafe - more time to relax and shoot the breeze.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

The food is expertly seasoned, well presented and extraordinarily delicious.  Memorably delicious.

What's more, the family who owns this restaurant is expressing its values in placing this restaurant where it is, designing it as they have (using furniture and accessories from the area and from a by-gone time), and adding touches that typically are found in cafes located in New York, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago...

The service was really, really slow. I was there with two friends -- we were the only customers in the whole place, and it took us two hours to get through the meal. 30 minutes for a salad, an hour for an appetizer (which came after the salad, because they forgot about it), and then an hour and a half for our dinners.  

They were insistent that we order alcohol, even though none of us drinks. They had three or four alcohol menus, and instead of bringing them all at once, they waited and brought a new one every time we refused an old one. ""Are you sure you don't want something from the bar?"" Yes, for the third time, we're sure. 

We ordered the baked brie as an appetizer, which was very tasty. I had the corn risotto in mushroom caps, which was good, if very bland. I agree with another reviewer - the kitchen should use some salt on these! My side to this dish was some spinach in vinegar. It was cold, pungent, and not at all what I expected from ""sauteed spinach"" on the side. I couldn't even stand the first bite and nearly had to spit it out. My companions seemed to enjoy their black bean burritos. The kitchen was not accommodating to a customization without tomatoes. 

It might be worth it if you're going here for some music and appetizers. I probably won't be going back, though.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Atmosphere is probably the best part of this place.  Very chill euro cafe feel with a hybrid alcohol/espresso bar, tables in the back, a back patio and live jazz DJ.

Food comes in a close second.  2-3 salads at $6-8, couple of apps and 4-5 entrees from $10-15.  Goes without saying it is all vegetarian and they are very careful to ask if you want cheese or anything else in case you are vegan.

Partner had the kale and black eyed peas over grits, her favorite dish to make!  It was a large portion, and fairly tasty.  I had the corn risotto over a portabello cap with sauteed spinach.  Dear chef: don't be afraid to use salt!  Especially if you don't put it on the tables!  Both dishes were tasty and inventive but frankly they were tempting fate with the big ""B"" word!  Just wasn't as satisfying as vegetarian and vegan food can be.  That slight misfire is all that kept me from giving 5 stars.

Oh, and they have a full bar!  The martinis looked good but we went with beer, with about 10 decent selections.  Wine list is a bit less inspired with 4 grocery store by the glass offerings.

Service was excellent, we basically had two servers attending to our every need.  Can be a bit loud!  We'll be back for sure!","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

The cafe was cute and comfortable.  A small bar area seats about 8-10.  A back patio is great if you happen to be out with your pooch and want to stop in.

For a late dinner, we were presented with a dinner menu that had about 5-8 choices for the day.  Everything on the menu sounded good.  Snooty food....my kind of food.  A dinner salad preceded our meal that was mixed greens with a raspberry vinaigrette with shaved Parmesan.  Not bad.  Not much to it, but not bad.  For my entree, I ordered the portabella mushroom stuffed with corn risotto surrounded with red beet and cabbage slaw.  Sounds amazing, right?  It was bland.  Could have been a fabulous meal, but it was definitely lacking something.  My mom ordered the black bean zucchini burrito.  It looked beautiful, but again, the taste was lacking.

I give them an A for effort.  The cafe is great and the menu presentation is awesome.  The food just needs some more flavor.

Both the butternut squash lasagna and the eggplant parmesan on polenta were delicious and they both came with sizable side salads that you would normally pay another $4-5 dollars for in other places (or they would jack up their entree price to compensate). Here you get both for under $10.

With my ice tea, that she forgot & I had to remind her (they were not busy), I paid $6.25...what a rip off! I said that's really sad for 3.99, she said well u should've read the sign, 1 egg/1 bacon. Um, I did read the sign, that didn't change the fact that it was pathetic food. She then said u could've got the 4.29 menu item that came w 2 eggs, potatoes, etc. I said, that would've been nice to know & good customer service to advise me since I had told her I never been there before & especially since I didn't take the toast, u think she may have offered something different. Why in the world would u offer a ""special"" that's a worse deal than a menu item?! That's a tricky way to rip people off.

It really is unfortunate because I was really looking forward to eating here. 

It all started with the service. We put our name down and the hostess asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside. We asked if the outside was shaded etc. she told us that they had a gorgeous patio with fans shade umbrellas etc. so we said outside would be fine. After 15 mins she took us to a patio with no fans, no shade and a bunch of smokers. We told her that would not work and she accommodated us elsewhere. (After another 15 minute wait.) 

The food was beyond subpar. It was downright nasty. I ordered their chicken sandwich. (Supposed to be one of their most popular with peanut butter, slaw, siracha and so on.) When I got my sandwich the grilled chicken was chewy and tasted like what you would get at the school cafeteria. My bun was most likely made by wonder bread. My fries were undercooked and soggy. 

To top off the bad food we didn't have good table side service. It was like they wanted to flip our table so fast we had a different waitress asking us every 30 seconds what we wanted to eat before we ordered. JUST GIVE ME A SECOND TO LOOK AT THE MENU!  

To top that off I went home feeling sick and got mild food poisoning. I will not be back and will not recommend this place to anyone.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

My sister specifically stated wanting yummy greasy food to feel like she was back home in the states so this restaurant seemed like a great option. Upon entering, we loved the punk vibe of the restaurant and the awesome music playlist. The hostess was very sweet and got us seated quickly. We then had a friendly waitress quickly take our order. We ordered drinks which were all really good and fairly priced. 

The low ratings are for the actual meal. I don't know if I came here on a bad day or if I just have superior taste buds but the food here was terrible. I ordered a white trash burger and it tasted like a middle school cafeteria burger. The beef was low quality, dry and lacked any flavor. I only took 3 bites and was over it. My sister had the chili dog and that too had a terrible quality of meat and lacked any great flavor. The pimento cheese fries were good but didn't have enough cheese so many of the fries were dry. The fish taco also was mediocre. The wings were like any standard wings, nothing special.

Overall, if you want a cool vibe with good drinks and friendly service, give this place a try. If you're actually trying to eat some decent food, find another restaurant.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Littered with bumper stickers on the ice cooler, kitchen door, and beverage cooler is home to an energy-filled staff dressed in Pinky's t-shirts but showing off their individual style south of the t-shirt.  The restaurant has posters and signs from local events covering every open space of wall real estate and the wooden furniture proves to be an inviting touch.  In here you can yell, laugh, and order filling portions of bar food designed to intrigue you enough so that you read every description on the menu (i.e White Trash burger, Pterodactyl burger, Camp Green House Salad). 

Because I love seafood, I went with the Corn Dog Shrimp.  Although I usually don't have any expectations, I was surprised when my meal choice did not work out.  As I waited for my order to come to the table, I observed many plates of food passing me on middle school plastic cafeteria trays (another cool and funky style of Pinky's).  The burgers were huge, smelled sinful, and the hot dogs, corn dogs, soups, and salads I saw made me want to eat everything that passed me.  

I munched down on my Shrimp Corn Dogs and realized the combination was a bad mix. The sweet corn dog batter wrapped around shrimp did not work.  I did not know if the honey mustard worked best or the tarter sauce, so I used both.  I ended up removing the bread from the shrimp and eating them separately with the condiments (shrimp and tater sauce, bread and honey mustard).  Needless to say, it left a harsh after taste in my mouth and the potato salad was not my friend.  It has a gritty look to it and an herbal taste.  If you are looking for something with crunch (red onions or celery) and herbs, try the potato salad.  

Will I eat here again?  Yes, but I have to try their burgers and leave the cute, unconventional food parings listed on the menu to the more daring crowd. 

BTW:  I will sit outside next time.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

It was sub par to say the least!   Before even getting to the ultimate fail of the peanut butter, the chicken ""pattie"" and cafeteria-like white bun really deflated any chance of this being worth it's cost.  Both were clearly mass produced, frozen, thawed, warmed and slopped on a plate after being cooked in an admittedly decent array of spices.  The only reason I ordered this particular sando was to partake on a thai like peanut/spice journey and to take my first bite and arrive with a thick schtick of crunchy Jif on the roof of my mouth couldn't have pissed me off more.  This sandwich seriously had potential, but it's like someone gave up along the way and settled for ""this will do"".
That being said, I'm willing to give the joint another shot for two reasons:
1.  The white bean hummus was tasty.
2.  They were giving away free beer in lieu of not having secured their ABC permit.
I sincerely hope this place makes it b/c it's great for the neighborhood, but I feel there are some menu offerings that need to step it up a notch.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Food: 4/5 stars. Really great sandwiches. The spread in their chicken sandwich had very good flavour. The smoked salmon sandwich with cream cheese and capers was a good combination. Tasted fresh and was big enough to be filling.

Service: 5/5 stars. I went around lunchtime and the lady who i presume to be the owner helped me at the counter. Amazing service and she was very helpful with making my choices. She was extremely smiley so that was a plus in my books.

I wondered what would take the grocery store's place...
Fast forward six months later and I couldn't have been happier to have the Italian Centre Shop open in that same location! It is truly a mecca of all things Italian (though I keep on bothering Gino to bring in some 'roast your own' porchetta) and European. I usually go in the middle of the afternoon on a weekday so that I can have a cappuccino and explore the aisles at my leisure and I find something new (to me) on the shelves every time. Squid Ink, Quince paste, frozen sour cherries...and all of it at pretty decent prices. I buy all my deli meat and some cheeses at their deli, which they say is the largest deli in Western Canada and I've even found a variety of olives that I adore. Don't forget to stand staring in amazement at the wall of cheese or order one of their freshly made pizzas with the best chewy/crispy crust to go. I do think, however, that they need a better system for ordering pizzas. It isn't obvious that you have to go directly to the till to order a pizza, especially when everything else can be ordered over the counter. I was waiting for quite a while my first time ordering and was wondering how come so many nonnas were zipping right by me with their little excuuusaamee's :)
I love that, in addition to the hard to find imported goods, you can find so many local products, like Messenger Meats Piedmontese beef and peppers grown right in Lacombe, AB. 
I think that it's fair to say that a store of this size and quality might have some growing pains in the first few weeks of operation. The staff have taken on a huge learning curve and are getting more informed every day. I find the number system at deli's to be quite useful (they are used in Europe and other countries) when used consistently (when it's not busy they don't use it and it gets confusing) and I think people should just roll with it. 
Oh, and if you live 'down south' like I do, you can buy espresso on your way to work as the cafe opens at 7:30 am.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

This place is crazy on a Sunday morning. 
You can do  your groceries, take out food or sit in at the cafe. They offer catering as well.
While they don't have the largest of selections for produce, they have a million choices of meat, tons of cheese, in house baked bread as well as oodles of pasta (boxed,bagged, fresh or frozen) 
They are also a slew of options when it comes to olive oils/ canned & jarred goods, sparkling waters and desserts.

My go-to is the #1 on their Top10 list - a blended ice-milk drink with boba+brown sugar+egg pudding. They have a large tea menu to choose from and I haven't had a bad one yet in my dozen+ visits :) The Okinawa ice coffee taste like coffee ice cream! Lots of food/snack offerings as well, they're still testing out diff menu items (the hot pot and red-oil dumplings I liked are no longer available so that means I'll have to try more stuff).

I came here with five of my friends and four of them ordered small boba drinks. It came in a tall glass that looked like a large. My friend and I ordered regular sizes and our drinks came in massive 32 oz jars!!! I'm sure it could feed at least two or three people. They offer a lot of variety in their menu and the drinks are reasonably priced. I ordered the matcha milk tea with boba and red bean. The milk tea was not too sweet which I like. 

Our waitress was very nice and accommodating to us, especially considering that our group was pretty large and their establishment is quite small. She was so understanding when some of us wanted to change our drinks while ordering. She also made sure that each of us liked our drinks, and we all did!

I heard that parking can be a problem but I came on a Friday at 6pm with no issues. What I don't really like about Tea Space is that it's a sit-down cafe, so we almost forgot to pay for our drinks up front after being there for a couple hours.

Also, similar to my previously review on Bund Shanghai (located in the plaza diagonally across the street), Tea Space is in a very sketchy mini plaza, but they have transformed the interior to a cozy, neighborhood tea house. Their extensive menu includes snacks such as dumplings and even hot pot in addition to coffee,tea, and yogurt!

If you're the type who can't decide, look no further than their easily visible Top 10 menu behind the counter. It looks like the rankings have changed a bit from previous photos. At the top of the list was the Okinawa coffee with sea salt latte, which was the one I ended up trying. For $0.99 more, you can get a 32 oz. ""regular"" size, which felt like I was drinking a Big Gulp. It was a little on the sweeter side and if I were to order it again, I would get 3/4 sweetness. Other popular drinks on the list include wintermelon, Hokkaido milk tea, and ice milk. 

My girlfriend mentioned that this tea house is similar to Half and Half for those of you who are fans. If anything, it's a cool place to hang out. Also, it's right next to Church's Chicken, so there's also that.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

This place would probably be in one of my top picks (along with Brew tea and Half and Half). I love boba and it was nice to find a good place because I have tried a bunch of other places which were either decent or straight up horrible. This place definitely reminds me of Half and Half because of their menu design and drink selections. 

So far I have tried the lavender milk tea, iced milk with caramel, honey green tea, and strawberry milk tea. All of these drinks were pretty good and I love how the regular size is super huge, but it makes sense since you are pretty much paying $6 bucks for a drink. You can definitely taste the tea in the drinks. My biggest pet peeve is when my drink straight up tastes diluted. I'd expect to at least taste some hint of the tea.  The boba quality has definitely gotten better compared to the first time I got here. I'd say it ranks up there along with Brew Tea. 

Also, the staff is super nice so if you aren't satisfied with your drink they will gladly remake it until you are happy. I do have to admit that I had to have my drinks remade at times, but they turn out pretty good. I am tempted to try the Hokkaido or Okinawa milk tea, but those are my go to drinks at Brew Tea and I probably have high expectations because of that. 

I would highly recommend checking this place out if you are in the area. If worse comes to worse, Kung Fu is literally right across the street lol. Their design is also awesome! It has that hipster cafe kinda vibe to it. The best part is they have cat pictures and other cool artwork (super heroes, Alice in Wonderland, etc). They even have a black cat in a bird cage xDDD.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

I ordered a small iced wintermelon green tea less sweetened, and a friend had the regular iced lavender green milk tea with boba. The wintermelon green tea was great, very refreshing. I'd say the lavender milk tea was a bit weak, a little too much milk and not enough of a lavender flavor. But on the plus side, the drink portions are plenty. If you are familiar with KFT, a small size here at Tea Space would be the same as a medium at Kung Fu, and a regular a large. Although having a large-sized regular is a good deal, the regular sized lavender milk tea wasn't cold enough because the ice would remain at the top of such a tall cup..
They have a stamp card for a free drink after ten. The staff is very friendly and service is good. There is an art wall on the interior where local artists have displayed art (mostly of cats) for sell. Great idea, it not only benefits and supports local artists, but also the cafe and its interior decorations.

They have somewhat late hours during their soft opening, until 11pm roughly, which is fantastic.

They have a good selection of drinks made in various ways with green or black tea and lots of different kinds of toppings. Their boba was hot and fresh, even in my iced drink, which by the way was GIGANTIC. I think the ""regular"" size here is around 32 oz, but for the same price that many places charge for a 24oz. One interesting point I would like to note is that whatever flavor/ingredients they use to make their drinks did not ""dilute"" or fade a few hours later when my friend had a chance to taste their drink, which can sometimes happen to other places' drinks that are otherwise fine.

The honey boba has a palpable sweet taste to it, which I love. I got the Okinawa (brown sugar) milk tea with boba, and my friend got the Honey black milk tea. The Okinawa tea had a very strong flavor, which I liked a lot. I tried some of the honey black milk tea, and personally prefer honey black milk tea to have a stronger flavor whenever I get it myself, but it was still delicious.

If I could change anything (which maybe I could have, I didn't ask, so ... who knows!) it would be that I'd prefer a little more boba to be included with the regular size as standard. I think next time I come I will order extra boba, as I think other places tend to put a tiny bit more by default. Also, the boba was fresh and chewy, but I think I prefer my boba to be just a little softer/squishier (not soggy necessarily but yeah).

Both employees working at the front on 10:30pm Saturday were extremely polite, and made me feel very at home - the cashier answered any questions I had without hesitation. I think this place will very soon be one of the best boba spots in Vegas once they get settled in fully, even when compared with the slew of other boba places nearby in Chinatown.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

However, in comparison to most pizzas I've had while in NYC, the one's I had and still have in Cleveland taste like the nasty ass pizza you got at your school cafeteria or the cafeteria at your place of employment (assuming its not delivery of course). HOWEVER, Edison's has saved my day. The pizza here is perfect for the Cleveland palate. It is zesty, sauce has fantastic flavor, the cheese is delicious, and the crust is soft and chewy. It's not a thin crust like a New York pie, but not a thick crust like Chicago. It's right in the middle like Cleveland is geographically. The wonderful people who run Edison's really  put a lot of care into their pizzas and everything else they make. You see it when they prepare the food right in front of you, and when you taste it at home or in the bar next door. After every pizza comes out of the oven they rub this oil mixture all around the crust, then sprinkle an Italian cheese mixture on top. that's what makes the pizza good to eat from beginning to end. Also, they are the only pizza joint I've known to ever introduce honey as a side dipping sauce. It's not my personal favorite but others love it and I can see how the flavors surprisingly go together in a weird but beautiful way. I respect that kind of innovation, for lack of a better word. All in all, this is a great pie. If you are from here, got to Edison's to have your mind blown. If you are from a pizza town like NYC and Chicago, come here to have a piece of home and a piece of Cleveland all in one.

One more thing, before I stopped eating meat I had their chicken wings, 3.5 stars to those. Very good for a pizza joint IMO. I have also had their cheesy garlic bread sticks, 3.5 stars to those. Finally, their eggplant parmesan hero sub is great too, 4 stars for sure.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

The worker gave me a sample of the house milk tea (which is what I ended up going with) and explained that what set them apart was that their drinks put more emphasis on the tea taste. It was true! Very strong tasting and not artificial at all! Though I only tried the one so far, they seem to have quite a few variations and customizing options you can do to your drinks and toppings. 

There are games in the corner to fiddle with, and a seat in the back with a charging station; ideal for people who want to sit for a bit, drinking boba and playing on their laptops. Workers were enthusiastic, and the drinks were good! I'll definitely be back!

I usually order just regular coffee like balzac's blend. I don't really order anything specific. Call me a boring coffee girl.

It has the feel that it has been there for 60 years and the main ""diner"" side has never changed.  I love seeing seniors lined up at the bar eating their breakfast and having their senior breakfast club.  
The new owners are hard workers, extremely dedicated to their cafe and the Black Earth community.  They have it going on.
I have a variety of their breakfast- traditional American, traditional British and they even have delicious Norwegian Pancakes too.  
Biscuits and muffins are scrumptious and even my sister in law from Georgia says the biscuits were to die for.
I have only been for breakfast, but they serve lunch and dinner as well.  
Family friendly, cash only, absolutely on my list to return over and over again.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

The place is extremely neat and clean and off to the side there is a Tea Room that is quite fancy and very inviting.  They have watercolors on the wall for sale by a local artist and the works are very nice too.
The owners were very friendly and laid back which we like.
The menu was simple and straight forward which is a big plus in our book.  We really dislike overly detailed menus.
Our food was good to very good all the way around but off enough to pull this review down to 4 stars.
The bread was delicious (some of the best ""appetizer"" bread we have ever had) but we would have liked some whipped butter with this and had to use butter packets instead. Not a big deal though.
We ordered fish which was very good.  (not sure what the economics are for this area but an all you can eat cod dinner for 9-10 dollars would be nice.  We recently had an all you can eat cod dinner for 7 dollars at another location.)  The fish was cooked perfectly and the breading was not greasy and very good.
The coleslaw was very good but the vegetable dish was unusual.  It had a good flavor but the carrots were hard and undercooked.  Not sure if this was how it was supposed to be or not.
Mashed potatoes excellent.
Our dessert was well made and of large proportion.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Previous reviewers have it right- it's an old-school, New World Italian bakery. It's been around since 1960, and on the walls are pictures of the various owners. It occupies two storefronts, one of which is taken up by the bakery racks, deli counter and a modest grocery section, and the other is occupied by the hot table and cafe, which serves up espresso and red-sauce Italian food at reasonable prices. The cake and cookie case and the main cash take up the centre. 

The bread is the highlight- spaccatelli buns with a crisp crust that shatters delightfully and a light, airy crumb, to a rich, dense, chewy ciabatta that needs no adornments to savour. Most breads are available as buns or loaves, and you can even bring them over to the deli to have a sandwich made. They stock traditional salami and capicollo, and even imported Italian cheeses. The only oddity is that I don't think I have ever paid the same price for a sandwich! Glass bottles of Coke and cans of chinotto make an ideal accompaniment.

The desserts are delicious too, from the cannolli to the diplomatico (think Napoleon with a chocolate custard layer).

Definitely worth a trip, you'll never leave without something in your stomach or tucked under your arm!","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

I know that people often point to our ""rich cultural diversity"" or our ""commitment to multiculturalism"" but respectfully, I think that those labels miss the point. Diversity and multiculturalism are wonkish words; they describe the place, but not the people; and the true character of a city lies in its citizens. 

This is why I love Tre Mari. 

As old-school Italian bakeries go, it's as old school as it gets. 

If you google the joint, you see that it's located on ""Corso Italia""; in the heart of one of the city's ethnic enclaves. This is true, and if you were to drive on over you'd find yourself in the middle of kitchenware stores, clothing shops and bars, coffee shops and restaurants all blaring whatever soccer match is on TV.  But then, if you drove you'd miss how the neighbourhood changes along St. Clair. Going West on foot you pass Jewish, Jamaican, Filipino, Portuguese and Hungarian shops, with the added Thai or fusion spot thrown in for good measure. It's Toronto in a few blocks. Besides which, you get to build up your appetite. At Tre Mari, you'll need it. 

Ask me what's good, I'll just answer ""yes"". The space is old and worn, divided into a bakery with pastries out front and bread in the back on one side, and a hot table/cafe on the other. A small deli and refrigerated section take up some space as well, but most of their wares are available elsewhere at lower prices. 

The ambiance speaks to a time before communities became tourist destinations. One one hand, service is warm and friendly. On the other, it takes a few visits before you feel completely welcome. 

It's worth braving the initial indifference for some of the best bread in Toronto. Some local celebrity chefs may try to sell bread at grossly inflated prices, but it pales in comparison to Tre Mari's loaves. 

A lack of signage makes ordering a crapshoot, but since it's all good and inexpensive, roll the dice. I skip lighter-weight french rolls and baguettes in favour of more substantial fair; a flour-dusted Calabrese rectangle contrasts brittle crust with chewy, airy crumb. Olive and herb breads slicked with oil are softer and springier. A multigrain loaf is substantial and hearty, as is a round, docked pide bread covered in sesame seeds. If you're the DIY pizza type, it invites you to cover it in good mozzarella, then tomato sauce and a dusting of parmesan for a homemade knock-off Sicilian Slice. 

Pastries are uniformly excellent. Cannoli are worth leaving the firearms at home for. Napoleans soothe with proper custard. Donuts, while not Italian, are archetypes that put Timmy to shame. Drip coffee is pointless, but espresso-based beverages are worth a double-shot. 

 Even better, I have yet to pay more than four dollars for a bread that could feed me for a week. 

The cafe is the most interesting part of the restaurant. Apart from very decent pizza and the usual buffet suspects, the room is testament to how neighbourhoods change; it is equally divided between the people who built Tre Mari and supported it from it's birth, to a flood of Ethiopian immigrants. The groups mostly keep to themselves; unless someone scores a goal, and the place erupts as one. 

That's Toronto.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

However, I can review the complex from a prospective tenant's point of view.  
The apartment grounds are well kept and the office staff is nice.  I interacted with Rica the first time and she seemed to be very knowledgeable.  
She showed me a 2 bedroom 1 bath apartment.  The mountain views were nice and the apartment was in great condition.  I didn't like the cheap flooring and the countertops especially for the price.  Definitely opt for one of the upgraded units if available.  The place is a little pricey and a fee of $29 each month is added to your lease.  The $29 fee is non-negotiable and covers valet trash removal.  Don't get me wrong,  some people may like valet trash removal but I could save a ton of money doing it myself.  That fee is going to add up quite a bit over the course of the lease.  In all fairness, it should be negotiable. In addition, there is a $9.95 monthly building fee and another trash fee that involves the trash pickup from the trash bins that are located throughout the property.
Due to the size of the community, it should have two pools, but there is only one.  There is a nice Internet cafe.  Also, they have a gym which could be waaaaaaaay better.  The treadmills are extremely outdated as well as the ellipticals. I don't understand why the equipment is so old, especially when I think about how much they are charging residents per month.  I mean, it would be nice to have newer, updated equipment.  I'll definitely take my chances at a real gym.
The location is great because there is easy access to the highway.  I won't need to worry about parking since a covered space is included with rent.  If you want a garage, then expect to pay a whomping $100 extra per month.  Also, Centurylink and Directv are the only approved providers .  So, if you currently use Cox, then prepare to terminate your contract.  I don't like their after hours security company, Valley Protective Services.  I've called a few times and these people don't bother showing up.  So, I ended up calling the REAL police.
The office staff are awesome and very attentive.  I love that maintenance responds within 24 hours and even sometimes the same day which is usually unheard of in most complexes.
Overall, the place is pricey with a great deal of fees and if I didn't want to be so close to my job then I would opt to move to Scottsdale for the exact same price.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

They politely asked us if we minded but we didn't since we know it's difficult to stay open but do construction at the same time. Nonetheless, the restaurant was clean, staff was polite and seating was abundant.

The soup was delicious and full of flavor! I got the pho dac biet (pho special with everything in it) and it was full of flavor, a ton of noodles and lots of meat as well. Only downside like I said was it was a bit greasy that it coated my mouth. My husband got the Korean meat with broken rice and veggies and he liked it! The meat was cooked to perfection and the rice was just right.

Years ago I became majorly sick from a Del Taco. Then a few months after that at a different location I got sick again and it was probably one of the worse food poisoning I've had. Sad to say, I've had a handful of food poisoning experiences, but it's because I'm food adventurous and it's just a hazard of travel. 

I've avoided this plague for years. My BF avoided it as well because of the 2 times he also got sick. 

Leave it to kids to not cook your food right....specially when dealing with chicken.

I saw on Yelp though when it comes to talking about fast food, this kept popping up. I know that fast food is nothing great, but in my area I have very few late night choices and one is a Del Taco. I got curious if it was maybe better than I remembered?

We decided to give it a try again. 

I got some del carbon tacos and a chicken burrito. Not bad at all. It has real chunks of chicken instead of that ""cafeteria"" style chicken that was minced and reconstituted into a chicken strip with fake grill marks which is a plus. 

I can't quite say I'm a ""fan"" yet, but it's A-OK.

It's a Belgian beer bar. It's a burger joint. It's got a cafeteria feel going on with the cheap-looking tables and chairs. It looks like an 8th grader designed the logo and menu and artwork. It's the kind of place I could see on Gordon Ramsay's show in desperate need of a makeover.

So it's 5-stars as far as the beer goes. I decided to gamble on the mystery beer for 4 bucks. It was a decent lager, but nothing spectacular. My wife and I each had a burger (BBQ burger and Belgian burger). The burgers were good, the fries were abysmal. I would bet my house that they were frozen and re-heated Ore-Ida fries.

The food was just OK. For a starter we ordered the Bites and Frites. The Bites were very good, small pieces of boneless fried chicken tenders in a choice of sauces (we had honey BBQ, quite tasty). The Frites were meant to be authentic Belgian frites, but felt like a poor imitation; authentic or not, they just weren't all that good.

We then shared a classic Margherita pizza. The crust was very thin and crunchy, and hard to eat. The sauce tasted like it was nothing more than Hunt's tomato paste, straight from the can.

Service was attentive enough, and there are dozens (hundreds?) of beers on offer but, curiously, only one non-alcoholic beer (Kaliber).

I ordered my own creation. Anchovies, mozzarella and Parmesan cheese, mushroom, red pepper, jalapeños on crispy thin crust wood fired to perfection. You walk through a cafeteria style line and choose your own ingredients. A few minutes later I was enjoying a flavorful 11"" pizza with a fresh side salad for $13 and some change.

First impression: Small brick building by what looks like a roach motel and a parking lot totally full. Some really weird icky smell was in the air too..?
Inside is cramped with little orange tables, totally kitsch and cute. The staff were all very friendly and made sure our orders were taken as soon as we were ready, even to the point that different waitresses were asking to make sure we had coffee on the way.
The coffee's great and I was impressed with raw sugar on each table. 

The menu is small [literally] and I ordered the cheese omelette [cheddar] with mushrooms and hash browns. The hash browns were ridiculously oily. They would have been tastier without so much grease. The omelette was mediocre and I could have made the same in my own kitchen.  The whole wheat toast was probably the best part of the meal, and the jam tasted homemade and flavourful. I am not used to really greasy food like I was served [nor did I expect it] and therefore could not get through half my breakfast before my stomach started aching. 

The jist? Small cafe, great waitstaff, subpar diner food. Oh, and this might be good to know: there is no restroom in the place, so if you need to use one, you will have to go next door to that sketchy motel.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Since then, I've been religiously paying a visit every 5K miles for servicing. There were good times, there were okay times and there were bad times. But I do have to say my last visit was good with no major complaints. 

If you do decide to have servicing done here, make an appointment! I failed to do that multiple times and sadly to say, service was mediocre. I'd drive up to the service area and would sit there for at least 10 minutes until someone notices me. And if they notice me they'd tell me to hold on even if I'm the only one in the service bay. Expect to wait about two hours for an oil change. 

The two hour wait time is still the same even with an appointment. But the way they treat you as a customer is different as night and day. I pulled up to the service area and Chad greeted me and answered all of my questions without being pushy or impatient. Actually, this was the first time I worked with Chad and I was very impressed and satisfied with his service. Maybe if I had Chad beforehand, I would have been a happier customer. 

With oil changes, ask for a car wash! I always get one and they do a decent job. During the two hour waits, I bring stuff to do. Inside, they have plenty of tables and seating areas with TVs.

This was a surprise gift for my boyfriend. He had no clue I was taking him out to race cars. I called the morning of my appointment to make sure it was still confirmed because I never received an email confirmation like I was told I'd receive. After arriving Cia helped us at the front desk. She seemed as if she didn't care about anything the entire time she was checking us in. I put in the notes this was a surprise and that it was a gift that I purchased for the driver. She proceeds to say ""ok what cars do you want"" in a uncaring way. Very confused. Why couldn't she walk us through what we purchased online and what cars we were allowed to pick from? It felt as if we were a bother to her. Very bad feeling from the start having her greet us the way she did. She then proceeded to tell us the next briefing was an hour away from our appointment. Which no one told me about over the phone or online when purchasing this package. Why make an appointment at noon just to sit around for an hour to have a briefing at one. If I would have known that I would have made the appointment for one. After having to complain about this issue they were able to squeeze us in for a quick briefing. The wait for the Shelby mustang & Nissan GTR was quick. He said the coaches that drove with him were awesome & friendly. While he was waiting to drive I went to the cafe to grab a drink. I waited for 5 minutes and no one greeted me. I had to walk over to the gift shop to ask if an employee works the cafe area. Also, every single car had VERY squeaky breaks. So loud you could hear them from the second story balcony. Seems unsafe to me. The experience overall was great for him but disappointing on my side. Not worth the 400 dollars. Everything seemed unprofessional and unorganized.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

The glorious hot dog is one of the most perfect foods to follow a drunken pub crawl around downtown. It gives me a reason to set food once again in Container Park - a place that didn't interest me much before.

Keep in mind that you're getting gourmet hot dogs in here. A plain dog will cost you $4.99, with the fancier stuff going more toward $6-9. ~$8 is a little much to pay for one hot dog, but hey, I could tell they used some quality ingredients into my dog, so I'll let it slide. If you are more of the ""quantity over quality"" type, you may have to sit at a nearby casino cafe and order a gigantor hot dog that they usually serve for a couple bucks.

Price point aside, the hot dog I got was very good. I got the Crunchy Dog - a hot dog concoction with all sorts of crunchies all over it (bacon, potato chips, fried onions, etc.). It's also topped with nori (seaweed) and sriracha mayo to give a bit of an Asian twist. I wasn't necessarily blown away by it, but it was still good.

Would I come back? Probably. The price point is something that I'm starting to see from all renovations going around east downtown. There are times that I crave a hot dog and go out of my way for it. Cheffini's does one good and it's definitely some of the best in the area.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Service - the guy with the beard who showed us our table was knowledgable and welcoming, the two waitresses were the opposite. It pained me slightly to have to tip the girl that closed us out, but I always do anyways, because I feel weird about not. Empty plates piled up, drinks went unrefilled, and as more of our party showed up the waitress had to be summoned to get their orders going. 

Food - chips and salsa are bottomless, which is great if you're into Pace salsa and off brand tostitos chips. Cold pizza, called flatbread, is not flatbread, it's cold cafeteria quality pizza. Chocolate fondue = not tasty, whatever they used in place of melted milk chocolate tasted fake and strange. Pretzel bites = a torn up pretzel with some luke warm cheese to dip the bits in. 

Drinks - no alcohol, bummer, the food would be better with some. The green tea was really good. 

Hookah- tons of flavor options, we chose rose and melon, and were please with that. 

Price - food was a rip off, even if the prices were good, I could make better stuff and turn a profit on it for the same price. Hookah prices were comparable, according to my research, to other places. 

Atmosphere - nice decor, clean place, clean bathrooms. The exhaust system keeps the smoke levels down and the music is at just the right volume to have conversations/listen to.

3 stars, I would try another hookah lounge before I returned.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

First off, I will say this place is very cute. It is a good spot to meet up with a friend or just sit and work on your laptop; very quiet. It is immaculately clean.  There are plenty of places to sit inside and there was a sign inside suggesting the addition of patio seating soon, which will be nice. 

I ordered the cafe latte with macadamia nut flavor added. I am not exactly a coffee connoisseur but am an avid coffee drinker with plenty of experience trying different roasts and blends. I thought the coffee was just ok. I think it would have been better if a stronger brew was used for this type of drink; I tasted more of the flavoring and the milk.
 
In addition to the drinks offered, there was a nice assortment of gelato (upwards of 10 flavors) and numerous desserts. All of the desserts are homemade per staff. The desserts looked very good but I would just suggest a different presentation instead of having them covered in saran wrap. I could tell that the cakes were iced beautifully but the saran wrap mushed it down and made it unattractive. 

I think I will give their coffee another shot, but will just try a regular cup of jo before completely passing judgement.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

My sub was unremarkable.  The bread was just a little crunchy...either stale or spent a little too much time getting heated up.  It was okay, but not a place where I'd cross three lanes of traffic to go to.  That coupled with a pretty pricey sub you aren't having lunch w/ a drink and chips for under $20.

Woo Chee is probably the most affordable/cheapest of the AYCE KBBQ offerings here in vegas. At about $13 for AYCE (after 11PM) this place is a great value. But as many of fellow yelpers have noted, this value does cost a diner in terms of quality.

I am not saying that the quality food here is bad.. but it could be alot better. After 11pm they essentially stop replenishing the food in the buffet  (except for the meat) and diners are free to get whatever is left. When I got there are around midnight last week, I noticed that all of the salad, and much of banchan offerings were depleted. 

The meat itself is not bad but really impressive either. The spicy chicken is great and not offered at the other KBBQ places, and the jalapeno soy sauce is addition. I wasn't too impressed with their cuts for the bulgogi and beef as it seemed like it was mostly fat on it.

The interior is like most KBBQ places, minimalistic, but this place definitely has a cafeteria like feel to it. Woo Che is a great value, but there is a sacrifice on quality.

We actually came to Wooche as a last resort for dinner IF Tofu Hut was not busy. And it was. The only reason I agreed to go to an AYCE Korean BBQ is because Justin A. was craving for some meat. So since Tofu Hut (his favorite ayce bbq) WAS busy, I remembered hearing about Wooche through yelp so we decided to go. Funny thing too is that there were these two other guys at Tofu Hut waiting and they overheard us talking about Wooche and asked questions like where is it at? how much? is it good? Told them we can all find out. Not saying they joined us to eat, but they ended up going too. 

I agree with Misty Y. regarding Wooche looking like a cafeteria inside. Its an actual buffet style where you grab your own food. They have a separate section with 4 different types of soups, the meat section of course, vegetables, ""desserts"" - why I quote this is because there so-called desserts they had out did NOT look like desserts...weird jelloy thing? I couldn't tell you what the name was since there were no labels. Also, there's a fast food section, which kind of threw me off. Anyway, I only chose a few things here and there from the veggie and noodle section due to the lack of appeal and freshness. Who knows how long the food has been sitting there. Another thing, majority of the trays were halfway gone and no one bothered to even check or replenish them. Old leftovers, no thanks.

The soups weren't even hot. Tasted bland too me. The meats were good. I liked the thin slices of beef, chicken, and my ultimate fave...KALBI! mmmm. 

Overall, I am not sure if I would come back. I'm a little annoyed with the customer service. They have not once came to offer us any refill on water. We tried looking for the server to come by but never did. Finally, Justin had to pretty much go chase after one and ask for refills! This is like De Ja Vu with Elnino F.'s review on HK Star hahaha! what daaaaa haaaayylllll is going on with this whole water thing!?!!

Help! Someone rescue me from the slippery slope of AYCE or soon my arteries will cease functioning.

One of the 2 places was Wooche, a Korean BBQ buffet. For me, the highlight of the evening was the adorable turtle living in the lobby that popped his head up to say goodbye. The interior feels like a cafeteria, and overall, the combination of lighting and offerings gave the general impression of not being the freshest. 

The miso soup was okay. I had a large plate of their banchan offerings, and I didn't find one that I wanted to eat endlessly. Each offering was like a bizarro offering: kimchi that had a sweetness, bean sprouts that were too salty, radish that was too sour. Given that the main attraction to Korean for me is the banchan, this was a big disappointment. From the fast food bar, I sampled the lomein, and it too had an odd flavor, heavy on the white pepper. 

As for the meat, I nibbled on this and that. The larger hunks of meat were unimpressive, like a side of meat you may have been served in elementary school. The definite standouts were the pork selections, spicy chicken and the bulgogi. Actually, the bulgogi dipped in the jalapeno soy sauce was delicious, and the culinary highlight of my experience. 

I think there are better options in Vegas, perhaps a bit more expensive, but when it comes to meat, I am willing to pay for quality over quantity. Meat coma is not a good thing. I was leaning towards 2 stars, but the service is nice, value is pretty good, and I admit I have an innate bias against buffets of any variety, except Indian.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

We had read from Facebook posts how wonderful it was.  We now know that those comments were more based upon the fact that everyone out this way is just happy to have an alternative close to home, rather than substance!

First issue we encountered was that we had no access to the restaurant.  There is a card reader at the front door to the building, and if you're not a resident of one of the Estrella neighborhoods, (CantaMia is NOT considered one, even though our dues we pay monthly are exactly the same).  Luckily, a gentleman walked up after a couple minutes and used his card to let us in.  After that, we were able to walk directly into the small cafe sized eatery. 

We ordered the Brooklyn Family Pizza (pepperoni, sausage, and fresh basil).  The flavors were good, especially the sausage!!  The pepperoni was plentiful, but barely noticable, flavor wise.  The pizza as a whole was so under cooked that the middle was literally wet dough!  Also, a little too much fresh basil, in my opinion, but my wife really liked it. 

The service was excellent!  Jay was our server, and was extremely attentive, helpful, and informative!

There is a large group of couples here in CantaMia (around 12-15) that get together about once amonth, and are always looking for new places to go.  I won't be recommending this place until the accessibility issue gets cleared up!!

I visited Hot Dog Heaven near the end of January, 2012.  It is located in what was formerly Famous Uncle Al's Hot Dog & Grill.  While that place was decent overall, it was immensely better than the current eatery.

First Impressions:

The first thing you'll notice when you walk in is the feel that someone found an abandoned hot dog restaurant, is squatting in the location, and trying to pass off their own establishment.  Leftover, mismatch and weird decor is everywhere.  It just feels like a strange place the moment you step in the front door.

Menu:

The front of the menu states Hot Dog Heaven has ""51 Years in Business"".  I can not imagine how this is true, at this location or any other.  

The hot dogs range from $3.50 to $4.59, depending on what type you get.  The party I was with tried several different types, all equally disappointing.  You can also get a plain dog for $2.50, which is located in the 'Side Orders' section for some reason.  Ridiculously over priced for the size and quality of the dogs.

The actual dog is a standard, small, boiled hot dog with very little flavor.  As they were prepared, we were shocked to find the cook just grabbed them out of a tray, slapped them on a bun, and started topping them.  He had a griddle right next to him, why not toss the dogs on there for even 30 seconds to add some bite and flavor?

The chili on the chili dogs was bland, can quality at best.  Again, very little flavor.  The tiniest sprinkle of cheese was added, and plain white onions.  There seemed to be no interest in sprucing them up a bit in any way.  It was like I was in line at a school cafeteria. 

The kraut dog was awful, to the point where my friend didn't even want to finish it.   

They also have Hot Wings which are, believe it or not, $9 for 7 wings.  They do come with a handful of fries, but at that price you should get double the wings at least.  Even a pickle (yes, just 1 whole, bulk purchased pickle), will cost you $1.59.

The soda machine seems to be constantly broke, as one of my friends mentioned it was that way when he went his one and only time as well.  

Overall:

I could not be more disappointed in a place.  I was really hoping for a great local hot dog eatery, but this is not it.  Steer clear, while it's still open.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

The nice residential townhouses, the mature tree lined streets, the old theatre, the many cafes with beautiful terraces to enjoy - this is a neighbourhood that, if I could afford, would love to live it. I don't really spend enough time on Bernard street as I love it so much. A few weeks ago, at my sister's recommendation, we went to Le Petit Italien, a restaurant I had gone by numerous times but never actually tried yet. As the name implies, Le Petit Italien is a old school Italian restaurant - here was hoping however that it would rise above the base level Italian and show me something more - because there is nothing quite as sad food-wise as an Italian restaurant that seems not to try. The food just seems lifeless in those cases.

As this is an Outremont restaurant, the space is rather compressed and longer than it is wide. As such, Le Petit Italien needs to utilize the space efficiently and they do. A moon-shaped bar divides the interior dining area in two. The overall look is one of modern elements within a old space. I particularly loved their use of the exposed brick walls and tomato sauce cans as decor accents. Sadly the weather was not up to par for sitting outside so the beautiful terrasse was not available. Too bad.

We started with 2 appetizers. First up, whipped ricotta with black pepper, thyme and grilled bread. Whipping the ricotta added a light and fluffy texture to the inherently creamy and rich cheese. The addition of pepper, thyme and olive oil brought some extra elements but nothing that took away from the ricotta itself. Spread on the grilled bread and enjoyed thoroughly.

The other appetizer was the insalata prosciutto - prosciutto, arugula, red onions, parmesan and white balsamic vinegar. The first thing that hits you when you see this dish is that amount of prosciutto draped over the salad. As a lover of prosciutto, automatic winner for me already! The prosciutto was perfect, cut nice and thinly. The salad itself was nicely balanced but nothing special - the peppery arugula, the sweetness of the red onions, the rich parmesan and the acidic dressing all worked well together. Another solid dish.

I got to try three different mains after that. First up, the risotto fruit di mare - shellfish stock, mussels, clams, scallops, shrimp, red pepper puree and fennel. I am not a huge risotto guy - I enjoy it but it is rarely something I will order myself. This one was pretty good - the seafood was plentiful and the addition of the shellfish stock brought a deeper seafood flavour to the dish. The risotto itself was creamy and the rice was perfectly cooked - always a concern when one deals with risotto.

The second dish was the classic veal parmigiana served with pappardelle and pomodoro sauce. A large breaded veal cutlet covered in melted mozzarella, the veal was cooked well and still moist. The pasta choice of pappardelle and pomodoro was excellent and complimented the veal well. Another solid dish.

The final main was the penne con anatra - duck confit ragu with bell peppers and green onions. The real star here was the duck ragu - deliciously rich and meaty. Everything else here was simply a platform on which the duck was presented. I honestly barely remember any hint of pepper or green onion but frankly the ragu was so good, I didn't even care whether the pasta was penne or a simple macaroni. Loved this plate - thankfully since it was what I ordered myself.

For dessert, they had cannolis on the menu, so of course I had to have one - my addiction to them is too strong. Something about the combination of ricotta, orange zest and that crunchy shell gets me every time and thankfully I wasn't disappointed here. Not necessarily as fluffy as I expected but the cream was nice and rich - the orange zest brought a little acidic and chew that was noticeable. The outer shell itself was good as well. After i finished it, I wanted another one.... usually a good sign and further proof of my cannoli problem.

Lastly, we had a trio of profiteroles with chocolate ganache. Excellent cool gelato, fluffy buns and a rich decadent chocolate ganache. I was happy I had the cannoli first because it ensured that I wouldn't eat most of this myself. A excellent way to finish the meal.

Le Petit Italien was Italian cuisine done right which made me happy. It is not doing anything revolutionary menu-wise but everything we had was honest and well executed. A nice little evening in Outremont. The only true downside of the meal was not being able to sit on the terrasse but that just means I need to re-visit them again eventually.

I should also say I was weirded out by the spelling of this listing, which already existed when I went to write my review. (Smoothy?) Anyway, no matter. This place is great. It's like Jamba Juice but with food. Actually, maybe Jamba Juice has food, but this little cafe has a ton of options, including what you'd expect: wraps, salads, and sandwiches, most of them favoring black beans and/or sprouts. It's healthy. There are a few tables to sit if you'd like.

I had the ""Health Nut,"" which had blueberries, mango, almonds, bananas, and a choice of either whey or soy protein. Not wanting to be Miss Muffett, I opted for soy. But I doubt I could have told the difference anyway!

The only downside is just being in Legacy Village in general. But, through amazing luck, I snagged someone's spot as they were leaving. I must have been the only freak who went to a fancy-schmancy shopping center just to get a smoothie, but yep, that was me. Within 10 minutes, I paid back my parking karma for someone else to enjoy.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

The staff was super friendly and the décor reminded me of a New Orleans café. The first time visiting this place; my order started with a mimosa and beignets. The texture of the beignets was harder than expected. They could've been more light and airy. It didn't scare me off! When the waitress came back I ordered the Hey Lucy! Omelette (cooked w/egg white) and it was delicious! The waitress excitement about how much she like the Hey Lucy! was a reason to try it. Also, I love avocado! The omelette is filled with breakfast chorizo (crumbed sausage), avocado, sautéed onions, and green chilies. Also, topped with cheese, side of English muffin, sour cream and salsa. 

I decided to revisit Another Broken Egg with a friend because of my first experience. This time I ordered the Black Bean Benedict with another mimosa. The taste wasn't to my liking! The black bean benedict should be altered because it was to much going on with that dish.I sent it back!!! Just for the record the waitress was kind and understanding~ She simply asked if I would like to reorder and I did. My breakfast date ordered the Bananas Foster French Toast with coffee. The Banana Foster French Toast was amazing!!! The thick sliced Hawaiian bread was topped with a New Orleans-style Foster sauce, fresh bananas, pecans and whipped cream. SO DELICIOUS!! 

So how did I come up with giving this place 4 stars? The overall experience was pleasant. Both times the staff was extremely friendly, the mimosa was on point, and the food was pretty good. I will definitely revisit this place over a few local breakfast restaurants/cafe. The plan during my next visit is to stick with what I enjoyed the most. I will reorder a mimosa, either a different omelette, simple eggs, grits, fruit, or even the famous Bananas Foster French Toast. Remember everyone preference of flavors in food is not always the same! By the way the mimosas are the best!!","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

We arrived early Friday night to enjoy a drink before our dinner reservation. We sat down to a bar that was dirty with food scraps, three bartenders stood talking to each other until we asked a waitress if she could get our drinks, the bartender threw the napkins across the bar at us and took his sweet time about making the drinks. The bar was not overly crowded or busy, especially considering the number of wait staff working. He couldn't be bothered to place the drinks in front of us, but at the edge of the bar on his side.

I can honestly say, in my 63 years, this is the rudest I've ever been treated in a bar or restaurant.

In the restaurant, the service, again was slow, but friendlier. The lighting however was cafeteria bright. We asked if it could be lowered, and they did slightly. But all in all, still much too bright for what one would expect from a dinner establishment.

I would not recommend the place to anyone.

1. Overpriced -  absolutely true. Drinks, salads, hot bar, soup, you name it - it's overpriced. Most of the food is not worth the prices. 

2. Disorganization - when this place gets busy you start to feel like Clark Griswold driving around that traffic circle in European Vacation. No flow to the traffic whatsoever. It's fine at 2 am, crazy at 2pm. 

3. The whole paper writing thing. I too think this is dumb. Particularly since newbies don't know the secret and spend 10 minutes looking around wondering how to get a sandwich before they figure it out. Usually when I'm in there I have to help at least one person figure out this secret procedure.

4. Never enough seating at busy times. Poorly laid out seating area leads to frustration for visitors. As an employee, I never sit in to eat - I think it's rude because I know a dozen other places to go eat, while the visitors know none.

All that said, ABP is ok. The soup is what keeps me coming back. And the asiago cheese breadstick! They have a fantastic soup selection and any of them I've tried have been excellent. My new favorite is Southwestern Chile Bisque.  Decent food for which you'll pay a mint.

I've had cafe ole in Buenos Aires, and Espresso Macchiatto in South Beach, Florida. Let's just say, if I could, I'd hook coffee up in IV form.

But enough about me, let's talk AROMA!
I've visited their promenade mall location the very first time. I thought the decor and color scheme was enticingly chic and welcoming. I noticed they sold ALFAJORES (if you have no idea what these babies are, do yourself a HUGE favor and google). I asked the barista if this was a south american company and why they offered such a rare-find sweet and she explained that the owners are Israeli and that Argentinian food is quite popular in Israel.(You learn something new every day).

I just had to buy them to enjoy with my coffee and it was incredible! Very similar to how I make them at home (that's right Yelpville, I can cook too)
I was over the moon when I realized that Vaughan Mills was going to have the privilege of an AROMA location.
No offense to Vaughan Mills fans but the mall is horrible. We'll leave that for another review.

Aroma in Vaughan Mills also offers alfajores: but a blind person could put them together better than these guys. (No offense to the blind, but these things were awful) I thought, they look bad, but do they taste bad?...almost $5 later and YUP, they tasted bad too....so dry. I really do hope people don't buy them thinking thats what they ought to taste like. 

Everything else is nothing short of excellent!
Espresso is fresh and well put together. They know how to make it all...and if you haven't already...you must TRY THE LONDON FOG!! Best. Tea. Ever.
It's not a tea, its an experience....: earl grey with vanilla and steamed milk. Mmm!

Complimentary iced lemon water and a delectable chocolate with every drink.

Excellence just draws me in to places like this....tell me what you thought!?

ALSO- I'm sorry I only posted pics of my one drink with this review, but I did try more things:
I've had various coffees, cookies, etc....

I highly recommend:
The chocolate brownie (its chocolate and its a brownie) 
The cinnamon raisin roll- it was AMAZING!
The croissant- cheese and butter- the french get it right every time!
The hot chocolate deluxe with whipped cream","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

At least on the weekdays, during the day. On the weekends, forget even trying! This place gets absolutely crammed with families & old people taking a breather from their sluggish promenades around the circuit of the mall. 
Anyhow, during the weekdays it is far better to sit in here than in the Starbucks outside the mall, which is always slammed with ginos and ginas, or the starbucks inside the mall (which doesn't have seating...huh?). There's a wide variety of seating to choose from, benches, high tables, circular tables with comfy-looking swivel-armchair-type-things, or booths, which are personally my favourite. The only thing is, I'm not sure there are many power outlets in this cafe, in fact there may not be any whatsoever, but you'll have to double-check that...I think this cafe was opened mainly as a luncheon place for shoppers, and not as a sit-and-read spot. There is also much seating outside, with little tables. 
You have access either to aroma's wi-fi, or to the central Vaughan Mills wi-fi, both of which work well. 
I haven't tried the food at this particular Aroma, but from my experience with other Aromas, and from judging the amount of satisfaction reflected on others' faces as they consume the food, I presume it is quite tasty and fresh. 
The coffee is great!! The drip coffee is superb and dished out in generous sizes. The cappuccinos/lattes are also fairly decent, as good as one is going to get from a coffee chain. Quite superior to those brewed by Starbucks, Second Cup, Tim Hortons, etc etc. 

But actually my favourite thing is the machine by the door with the different smiley faces/frowning faces on it that you push on to determine your level of satisfaction.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Samurai Comics is the Cheers of comic books. You walk in and everyone's glad you you came. Even the other customers, who will look up from reading their new copy of New Avengers to send a nod in your direction. It's like saying hello but without the commitment.

The tables at Samurai Comics are like the multi-purpose rooms of your junior high (we called it a cafenasium). While on the weekends they're used for Magi-Yugi-Poke tournaments, during the week you'll find people pulling up a chair, setting their Jones on the table, and plowing through their purchase. Sometimes people set up other kinds of board games on the table, like Steve Jackson's Chez Dork or Munchink series. 

Occasionally a D&D game will spring up. And the Yugi-Magi-Poke/WoW players point and laugh at them for playing with dice and graph paper. And the D&D players point back and laugh at them for having 0 Charisma points. That's even less charisma than an orc whose been badly burned in a fire caused by a Level 12 Wizard with an attitude problem. Laughs are had by all. And then everyone's parents come by to pick them up and the cycle repeats.

While I've been known to occasionally bring out the +3 battle axe and get my berserk on with a green dragon, I come to Samurai for the comic books, specifically their collection of graphic novels & trade paperbacks. And the selection is massive. In fact, so massive that it cannot be contained in one store. 

Many a times I have gone to the counter, downtrodden and sad at my inability to find a particular trade paperback, only for Mike (the owner and I'm pretty sure the reincarnation of the Greek God of Geekdom) to call the other location, find said copy, and even give me a discount for having to make the drive. It almost covers the cost of the gas to drive down to 7th street.

Before Netflix, I used to come here to get my quirky relatively unknown movie hookup. And I even gave mangas a try. I mean, why not? At the table is a kid who blew his week's lunch money on Yugioh cards, two guys discussing the finer points of Wonder Woman cover art, and a guy wearing one of those Naruto headbands complaining how Heroclix is no longer cool ever since it went mainstream and sold out. What, I'm going to be afraid of saving face?

The only thing that keeps this from being a five-star review are the weekends. The weekends are when the aforementioned Yugi-Poke-Magi-Wow players gather to play their little tournaments. 

Imagine three dozen mouth-breathers all crammed into a comic book store, some of them forced to lay on the ground for lack of space, getting their burger king-stained fingerprints all over the merchandise and counter, raising the temperature inside the building to ten degrees above whatever is outside. 

There's nothing you can do about it. As annoying this display of failed humanity is, it's a necessarily evil; their continued and existence, and more importantly, their parents' money, helps keep Samurai up.

But it's worth it for Samurai.

Browse their single issues or trade paperbacks and see for yourself.

Or go all out nerd. Buy a fucking action figure or something.

I keep telling myself that after I'm more financially stable I'm going to start collecting Wonder Woman merchandise. Of which there is plenty.

Maybe even a Wonder Woman outfit...hmm.

I won't lie. Samurai is not bargain bin. Unless it's on sale (they have a big fuck-all blowout once a year) they usually sell it for cover price. Which you could admittedly do at Borders or Barnes N' Noble too. But you won't, will you?

No, because you're into ""local"" shit. That's why you're on yelp. Nobody reads yelp for chains. Unless you're me and like to give silly anecdotes about those chains. But I'm meant to be the example to scare you straight.

Ha ha! Questionable sexuality.

Okay, time to wrap up with some relevant information...uh...you should give Samurai Comics a try because ultimately, it's not a store. It's an experience. And if you wish, you can become a part of it.

Come to any of their events (they hold a lot of them) and you will understand what I mean.

Or you can just buy your stuff and GTFO. Whatever works.

Oh, and if they have them in stock, try a Yogu Time from their fridge.

For rill, you have not lived until you've had a yogurt-flavored snack drink from Japan.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

If you're looking for a cheap quick meal and are tired of the typical fast food joints, the hot dog shoppe is worth a try, but don't expect to be amazed. Nothing on the menu really jumps out. I like the wedding soup, but it's probably canned, hot dogs are hard to screw up, and the burgers are reminiscent of a school cafeteria lunch item. The only thing that I really don't like on their menu is the cheese sauce, canned and sits in a hot pot all day.

I came for a late Monday lunch and was hoping to grab a patio table and do some people watching on the sidewalk. The cafe tables near the door didn't have waitress service and are right under some needlessly loud speakers. There were a handfull of tables in the enclosed patio area that just needed to be cleared. I waited a good 10 minutes for the tables to be cleared on a day that wasn't that busy. 

The only person cleaning tables was a super skinny waitress who clearly loathed the idea of clearing tables. Watching her apathy was one of the only highlights of the afternoon. 

The hostess was unapologetic. Eventually I asked her if the restaurant had busboys today. Her answer was  apathetic, too.

So I took one of the only open seats at the bar with my back to the street, and ordered. The food was only slightly better than the food you'll get at the average ""ethnic"" restaurant in a tourist town. The rice was surprisingly and confusingly garlic-ey. The beef burrito was meh, and tasted a little bit like freezer burn. It was shredded beef, not ""steak "" like the menu says. The Cadalic margarita was average. $18 for the burrito. $15 for the margarita. Why do I put up with this on-strip wallet abuse?

The pretty and pierced bartender was friendly and helpful, but I got the feeling it was due to her own good personality, not training or expectations of the restaurant. 

Overall feeling: Pay (and save) $10 for a cab and use Yelp to find a Mexican restaurant elsewhere that cares about quality and service. And I hope the bartender finds a place that deserves her.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Got a buffalo club sandwich (wasn't feeling the Mexican here) and it was ok, nice spice but nothing too heavy, and nice well-done fries, but $16?  Got a mini-cup of ketchup, asked twice for more and never got it.

Free margarita on the rocks coupons (market price 11 f-ing dollars for something smaller than Webster's trouser snake) but the waitress salted the rims when we asked for unsalted.

Chicken tacos thoroughly drenched in cheese, and tasted like a chicken sandwich, nothing great.

I'd avoid this like the plague.  There's a hell of a lot better in Vegas, even on the Strip.  I guess they gotta pay the rent for having the sidewalk-cafe vibe.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

We needed a decent restaurant to eat and drink at before we started getting ready for our night out on the town. The wait was give or take 30 minutes - which seemed like the longest 30 minutes ever. All of us decided to check out the menu so we can decide what we want once we sat down knowing the service was going to be slow since it was a Saturday night and the restaurant was busy. 

Within those 30 minutes I had changed my mind 3x on what to order. Grrreat - that's what happens when you give me time, I change my mind! On to the dining selections.... (we all shared) 

-- Appetizer Sampler - Beef Taquitos, Potato Skins, Diablo Wings (Mild), and Calamari (Rating: 3/5) The potato skins were delicious! 
-- Diablo Burger - The patty was at least inch and a half thick, the bottom bun was hard as a rock, but the fries were fried to perfection! (Rating: 2/5) 
-- Pulled Chicken Burrito (dry) with sauce on the side - According to my friends it was good. It came with rice, beans, sour cream, pico de gallo, and guacamole on the side. (Rating 3/5) 
-- Rockin' Shrimp Tacos - The shrimp was battered and deep fried served in a flour tortillas (3 small tacos) served with rice, beans, sour cream, pico de gallo, and guacamole. The shrimp tasted delicious (Rating: 3/5) 

The wait was a-okay, I was starving so my stomach was biased about the wait time here. The waitress was very attentive for the first half of dinner, she stopped by at least 3x to ask us if we were doing okay. However the last half of the meal we were completely ignored. The food was nothing fantastic nor was it that bad. If you're staying at the Monte Carlo and need a decent place to eat besides the buffet or cafe - come to Diablo's. Decent prices for the food and atmosphere makes it a fun experience.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

We came in for a late lunch on Tuesday and the place was packed, it is much smaller than Barlow but surprisingly we were able to get a table for two pretty quick.

Started off with two Caesar's and I ordered the 4 mushroom 7 oz sirloin steak and my husband ordered the 12oz peppercorn New York strip.  Heavy for lunch, yes, but we skipped breakfast and it was my birthday!

First I've noticed in my recent visits that the cloth napkins have disappeared and have been replaced with paper, I really think this move takes Cactus down a notch.  Not a big deal.  Secondly their Caesar's here are not prepared the same as Barlow.  They were garnished with a pickled green bean here, Barlow has this beautiful skewer of mini peppers, onions and olives and a lime wedge-which is the main reason I order the Caesar from here.  Disappointed that it came lacking that little skewer of pickled goodness.  Also it seemed over iced, by the time our meals came, it was a watered down significantly.

Our mains arrived in a reasonable amount of time but immediately my husband noticed that his steak was not 12oz, he is a beast and knows his steak.  Mine came out fine but it was lacking in salt.  He waves our waitress down and asks her if his steak in indeed the 12 oz peppercorn NY strip...she was a sweet girl and immediately  apologized and said ""I'm sorry I got you the 9oz peppercorn SIRLOIN!"" 

My husband and I are not unreasonable people and really, 3 more ounces of steak wasn't going to ruin our lunch but he is not a fan of the sirloin cut; less fat=less flavour.  He told her not to worry about it and we finished our meal.  Our plates were bussed by another waitress and our bill came, I would have liked to share a desert with the man as a small celebratory birthday sweet but we were never offered a desert menu so we just paid the bill and left.

I would have given a higher star rating if the waitress was on her game as the food was good but the Caesar's were just ok and the paper napkins remind me of a cafeteria.  

Might just stick with Cactus on Barlow.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

(Not biased, because I do take shifts there on occasion) This community centre is huge and definitely screams 'community'.
It's located right beside the hospital and that creates the worst part of the centre - the parking. UGH! The parking is a nightmare on weekends and when there's a swim meet in the pool. There is simply not enough space in the little lot and if you have to park on the street, you'll get a ticket. I've actually been late for my shifts because I had to park in the residential areas ... are you kidding? Also, the parking lot is a 'paid' lot, as in you have to get a ticket and you pay on the way out at the front desk. (You pay after a few hours)

The pool is lovely. it's huge, bright and spacious. The pool has a nice slide and a therapeutic pool- which a lot of pools don't have. It's definitely a 'hot tub' and it's a nice relaxing area after your swim. The pool is never really 'busy' as many of the markham pools are, and it's at a nice temperature so you can get a good endurance swim in. The viewing gallery is built for swim meets so it's huge, with a large overlook of the pool. 
The gym is a bit small, with not a lot of room for barbell lifting. I've only worked out there once, and the ventilation is not great. Had to stop running after awhile because I couldn't breathe well.
I love the fact they have a running track. Indoor running tracks are just amazing. 
The facility also has a huge empty gym area for drop in sports (basketball, volleyball etc) and an indoor playground for kids. 
The library is very modern (the outside looks like burberry LOL) and the inside is organized and it just seems like a great place to study.
Cornell is also getting a new cafe, which is a nice change from the other city of markham pools, which have nothing or a small dingy snack bar that's rarely open.

This community centre is super spacious and very nice. I like to work here and I like to visit, even if I live on the other side of markham.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

I have worked for them in the past as a supervisor and have worked at several other cafes so I am typically pretty lenient and sympathetic with all baristas in the world.

Having said that, my girlfriend and I wanted to grab some coffee for the road before checking out from the hotel. They had one girl as an expeditor taking orders to speed up the line. We ordered a reg hazelnut IB and a lg Orchard Peach iced tea. We paid and stepped aside to wait for our drinks. We received two reg sized drinks. No big deal- we let the barista know we had ordered a large iced tea.

Conflict resolution at a coffee shop is quite simple. The cost of avoiding an argument and satisfying a customer far outweighs the cost of remaking their order.

However, the employee here who decided to give us attitude, state that we had paid for a regular (regardless of the expeditor coming over and letting her know she had took the order for a large), and walked away after giving us back the regular sized tea obviously does not share my views.

However, the pulled pork was a little dry, and was under-seasoned - also swimming in thin, oily sauce, which kept running off the meat and making the tortilla soggy.

There are a group of office buildings in this plaza, and most of them have a sort of a cafeteria or a restaurant at the ground floor. My favourite was always the Mission Eatery.

It's a small little place, maybe 30 seats or so, but it's meant for a quick lunch break bite or so. Ownership of this place changed quite few times throughout the years, and current owner did it the best in my opinion. They revamped the menu and tweaked their best items to make them even better.
They have a website that they update every single day with the day's soup and hot main items which change everyday to give you that variety and break the routine of a fixed menu.

My star plate at this place is the Cobb salad with grilled chicken, it's probably the best cobb salad i've hd anywhere! And their Italian wedding soup (when it is available) is unreal!","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

They offer up an ordinary menu with a bit of a twist as they dabble in some oriental flavors. I noticed that they do potstickers, kimchi, and even have a banh mi on their regular menu, which is impressive.

I've had some breakfast here before and it's not bad. The breakfast is a bit small and overpriced, but you're also paying for the convenience because we work right by there as well. Also came recently for lunch, and thought it wasn't so bad. I had the Chicken Deluxe Club and it was a hefty looking sandwich. It was stacked with lettuce, mayo, thin slices of bacon, and a lightly grilled chicken breast with a fried egg and cheese. The sandwich ($6.95) was good, but a bit overpriced, especially with no sides or anything. Still tasted pretty good. Ordered a minestrone soup on the side that was more like tomato water with some veggies. 

I will say that the Mission Eatery probably has better hot food than the other cafe located nearby in one of the other office buildings, but that's not saying much. Would come back again for a quick lunch, but it's by no means a gourmet food eatery.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

What does Le Painnamou even mean? The word is fusion - obviously the first part (pain) means bread in French, and the latter part (namou) is Korean for tree. Together, bread tree!!!! Haha. Anyway, the name suits the little bakery perfectly and as I love Korean baked goodies, this place is a total gem in my books.

The selection of bread they have is small but great; many of its selection is sold out when I visit too late during the day (tells you how popular this place can be!). During the Summer, my husband and I frequented the bakery on a regular basis to cool ourselves down during the hot and humid weather with their shaved ice dessert.

This dessert is very popular in East Asia, and many of the countries have their own authentic versions of this dessert. In Korea, shaved ice has particularly been more popular than ever during the last two years even though the dessert itself has traditionally been served for over decades. The modernized shaved ice is almost always sold in any Korean bakery or cafe you visit, and Montreal is no exception. Le Painnamou has had one of the best and most authentic shaved ice we had ever tried, beating its competitors in Seoul, Los Angeles, Toronto and Vancouver!

What makes the shaved ice at Le Painnamou better? Hubby and I believe it's the quality of the ice, which is pre-mixed with condensed milk then finely shaved to give it a dry texture that instantly melts in your mouth. The ice doesn't melt as you enjoy your dessert, which I find is very important. The bakery is also very generous when it comes to its toppings; we've visited many cafes where we were left with just regular ice at the end because there was a shortage of toppings.

Our favourite flavours are the green tea and strawberry shaved ice, but there are many more to choose from! Mango, coffee, traditional red bean, chocolate... there is a flavour for everyone and each flavour can also be enjoyed by all ages! And it's very affordable as well - the dessert is available in 3 sizes (small, medium, and large) and all are under $10.

Ever wondered if you can take the dessert to go?

Well, you can! Hubby and I visited Le Painnamou one day in September to find it completely full with no place to sit. We asked if it was possible to have it to go...and we were surprised that they were able to do it! After receiving our dessert, we enjoyed the shaved ice outside (it was still warm back then). We quite liked the to-go version; it was very well thought out and efficient!

So, before it gets any colder in Montreal, I recommend you head over to Le Painnamou and try one of their shaved ice desserts! Nestled right around Guy-Concordia, it's a great way to treat yourself after a long day of school or work, plus it's not that high in calories (at least I think...it's ice after all). We hope you enjoy it as much as we do!","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

I could have sworn that the price displayed was less than what I paid for but I was distracted at the checkout talking with my friend. I would recommend getting the chipotle hot sauce instead of the  jalapeño. I think it's more flavorful, plus it's the one they use to use on the show. They carry all sorts of knick knacks which would make good gifts. I think there were some locally produced products available. I would love it if they made locally made products a little more obvious. The jewelry was cute, but not my style.

I go here mostly for the free gas or if i need emergency gas. I prefer to get my gas at Sunoco so i don't really get it here. If you are the average consumer and non biased there are good benefits to shopping here and getting gas.

They have this sheetz card that you can get in the store and can sign up with online. You save $.03 cents a gallon when you use this card which i guess after a while with count for something. They have more than enough pumps. Close to 15 or so i think all with credit card functions and those window washer squeegee things. 

Inside is almost like a convenience store. They have  coolers full of drinks from soda to milk, juice and energy drinks. They have an icee machines with really cool flavors along with a milkshake machine. You can choose the flavor milkshakes they have available and the machine makes it for you. They also have a MTO counter that offers hot foods, sandwiches and even latte's. I use to get their breakfast sandwiches a lot but have since changed my eating habits. 

The choices of food they have are becoming more and more mainstream like chicken and pizza but i wouldn't eat that stuff at a gas station anyway. The have a walk in cooler that sells two liters and 12 packs of soda for anyone who needs it cold right away. I guess it would cater best to family's coming through town who need cold soda right away. 

Beyond the aisles of chips and pop are your common gas station items, candy, energy bars, medicine, donuts things like that. They have an eat in cafe with about tables for 15 to 20 people so if you order something you can have a place to eat it other than in your car. They keep this store fairly clean and the bathrooms are awesome. Maybe the only bathrooms that are worthy of being in at a gas station. The big down side of this place is that they usually only have two registers open but typically have too many guest to cater too.

Sometimes this ""productive place"" outside the home is a local coffee shop, a cafe or even (gasp) a library. Yes, folks, a library. Where it's supposed to be all sorts of quiet and somber. I decided to pack up my laptop and bring her to the Myers Park library branch yesterday to focus and be productive outside of my house.

Here's the thing about the major changes with the Char/Meck library systems as of late, because of the budget squeezes, funding cuts and closings around the county, the libraries are really full at really odd times. Like a Tuesday afternoon. I figured this out yesterday as I tried to grab a cubby and get some work done. No such luck. No open tables, either. And really though, I can't blame them. This particular branch is pretty small and doesn't have a ton of ""working"" space. Plus, because many of the other (larger) branches are closed on Tuesdays, the Myers Park branch gets a ton of their overflow. 

Thus, the library was chock full of kids, Internet surfers and folks coming in and out to use their services. I take no issue with the crowded factor, as this branch is clearly serving its community and its needs. Yay for that! Just keep it in mind that this may not be as quiet as you think!

The folks who work here are very, very sweet and helpful. Not only did they help me find a few books for an upcoming beach trip, but I also overhead them helping anyone and everyone with a question or issue. As previously mentioned, there is a bank of individual cubbies for the working bees and a few tables near the back if you're lucky enough to score one. Literature wise, this is a small branch. But I highly recommend searching for your books online and you can request that the be put on hold at whichever branch you like. Thus, whichever library that has said book(s) will send them over to the Myers Park branch (or whichever branch you designate online) and they will notify you when they are ready to be picked up. Stroll on over to the branch, pick up your books, hit up the self-checkout and poof! Instant literature bliss.

A few other things to note about this particular location: the parking is easy but can be tight when they are busy. They offer free WiFi and have a small, but diverse, selection of magazines and media at your disposal. Here's hoping that the county figures it out and supports our library structure as a whole. They should be open every day, folks.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

My husband ordered the cold brew coffee and said it was really good. We were sitting in the cafe for quite a bit so he went to get a second and they were nice enough to just offer a refill.

What I think people misunderstand about Scratch (esp regarding location) is that Duc (the owner) wanted to create a casual french cafe and eatery (much like you would find on the streets of Paris). He didn't want to open a posh restaurant in Old Town where he could charge exorbitant prices. My opinion is that he wanted to create a place much like he surely experienced living in Paris: A place where you can sit and have a delicious french meal without it needing to be a special occasion. There are too few restaurants still in town where that balance is so precisely struck.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

We walked up to the dessert counter, and took a look at a marvelous selection of pastries.  We decided to grab two and head home.  We went with the Opera.  A chocolate cake with coffee cream covered by a hard chocolate dome.  Quite good.  We also had the Mogador.  A chocolate raspberry cake.  Also delicious.

To our surprise this little place is more than just a bakery.  It's a full blown french bistro.  A great cafe selection of sandwiches, salads, and breakfast items; along with a full dinner menu.  There's also a very intimate ambiance.  While there's not a whole lot of room in the dinning room, it doesn't feel too cramped.  The tables are also set up very nicely, it almost looks like your at a wedding.  I'm going to have to come back and give the entrees a try!","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

If you have lived, visited or had truly authentic french dishes (i.e. duck confit, foie gras, shoulder of lamb, etc) then you should run, not walk to Scratch.  The owner is a very genuine and caring man who is the chef and pastry chef! He is a parisian-vietnamese artisan who has traveled the world, photographed the most famous individuals and scours his food resources to provide you the best and most true foods.  

It's NOT like the other restaurants that give you  americanized versions of french food (i.e. Vincent, Petite Maison) . . .but it's a true meal where you can expect perfectly sauteed potatoes (perfectly fried the way you do in the countryside) with your wonderful meat.  

This beautiful little cafe / bistro offers the customers the very best espresso's and marriage freres tea,  Artisan pastries and the best most authentic french dinner for half the price you will pay at other ""french-like"" restaurants.  I paid 19$ for my filet mignon wrapped with foie gras on top with the sauteed potatoes.  My friend had the duck confit everytime we go and without fail, it has all been amazing.

They also offer non-french foods, such as mediterranean or asian fused foods, as well as brunch for the scottsdale-lite or almost scottsdale-lites. 

However, my recommendation: do the day thing, but DEFINITELY DO THE NIGHT THING.  If you appreciate truly home-made foie gras, make this your definite destination.

The ambiance is a wonderful modern with a sheeky boho parisian spiced into it.  It's so comfortable there and sandwiched in a strip mall because that's 99% of what's around here. Once you walk in, you forget about the other establishments that are just so predictable and enjoy a casual, but yet refined and sheek way to live again in France.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

I frequented Scratch when they first opened a couple of years ago but this little hidden cafe had unfortunately fallen off my radar as of late -- until today that is. While out and about on the town, my tummy started to rumble and I decided to take advantage of my iPhone yelp app to possibly find a sandwich spot that might not be top of mind. Scratch showed up and immediately memories came back. So I turned my car around and made a long overdue visit to Scratch. 

Scratch is an intimately small bakery slightly hidden within a shopping center on Miller and Indian School. But all it takes is one step inside for the character to appear. The space itself is small and relatively bare with minimal furniture, decorations or food on display. But once you glance at the menu and read the options you realize that the food is well thought out and of great quality. 

During my most recent visit, I opted for the turkey and avocado sandwich but I added Brie. I ordered the sandwich to-go and it was ready within minutes. The sandwich came with a mixed green salad with balsamic vinaigrette and I was ecstatic when I realized that they wrap the sandwich in saran wrap to save it from picking up any moisture from the salad. I wish that every sandwich shop did this because I can't tell you how many times I've had a sandwich with soggy bread because it wasn't separated from the sides. So thank you for that little special treat, Scratch! 

Moving on to the sandwich quality itself, tres bien is all I can say. The white bread was extremely soft and had obviously been made that day. The avocado was fresh and buttery and the perfect addition to the sandwich. The turkey was sliced and tasty and the sandwich in its entirety was delicious. Simply but delicious, just like the decor at Scratch. The balsamic vinaigrette was quite tasty as well and while the salad was lacking anything else besides two tomatoes, it was still nice to get some greens with the meal. 

While this was a great sandwich and I've also enjoyed the pastries and beverages from past visits, you do pay for the quality of food you receive. My sandwich alone without a drink or additional side was $10+. In other cities that might be reasonable but for Phoenix, it's definitely on the pricier side when you don't have a drink accompanying the price tag. But like I said, you pay for the quality of food and the quality of the sandwich was worth the $10 out of my wallet. I will just have to vist Scratch for a weekend lunch treat when I want a tasty sandwich.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Upon entering, you notice the internals of the restaurant are immaculate.  It is a less is more attitude on the decor and it works for the intended setting.  There is a viewing case of the offered pastries of the day and that is where you will find most people bobbing their heads in excitement of their anticipated treats.

Upon the initial review of the menu, I was happy to see such a strong price point in a specialty cafe.   Having your entire breakfast repertoire being priced below ten dollars almost made me want to try a few different breakfast ideas.  After a brisk review, I decided on the breakfast sandwich and an iced latte, while my companion chose the eggs benedict and a cappuccino.  

I could see the chef via the semi open kitchen, working furiously to move the orders up to the window for delivery.  Upon arrival, I was pleasantly surprised by a fluffy croissant filled with a perfectly cooked egg and ham stuffing.  The sandwich, while not huge in size, most certainly delivered.  The accompany spinach salad had side container of goat cheese, which made the entire dish perfectly pulled together.  

My companions eggs benedict turned out to be just one minaret of egg, ham, perfectly toasted english muffin and silky hollandaise sauce, rather than two.  The hash browns were home made, textured and tasty, making it a great accompaniment.  It should be noted that the heavy majority of restaurants serving eggs benedict consider two eggs the standard, rather than one, so be prepared you might want more.

Both of our coffee beverages were made with care and tasted great.  

I would recommend this establishment to anyone looking for solid food at a great price point in a comfortable atmosphere.  Further review coming after I visit again to try out their dinner ideas.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

It should be so good, you can eat it plain.
If you want to take it over the top, slather it with fruit preserves and drink with cafe longe or cappucino.

PAIN CHOCOLAT resembles the croissant, but hidden inside is a row of rich -- you guessed it -- chocolate.

Everything from their sumptuous vanilla green tea to the delicious sandwiches and crepes are amazing!  Everything that I have tried at Scratch has been quite the treat, although I would definitely recommend the BLTC accompanied with one of their many delicate, fresh made soups.  As I have been a Scratch patron for some time, I decided to try the restaurant for dinner as they recently opened Wednesday- Sunday nights. I must say I was more than impressed! The rich and savory flavors of both the Coq Au Vin and Chicken Normandy were excellent. The house red wine is a wonderful french blend that accompanies their meals perfectly. I adore the side dishes which consist of a delicious carrot puree and smashed potatoes that goes heavenly when dipped in the flavorful sauces.  My boyfriend usually orders the duck confit and every time he is more than satisfied and always compliments how tender and delicious the duck meat has been prepared. as if all these wonderful dishes were'nt enough, you MUST try their fabulous pastries!

Stopping by Scratch was random and well worth it. When my friend Kristin and I entered, we were immediately struck by its simply chic, fairly girly yet modern decor. Also, the fact that a group of women speaking French at one of the 3 outside patio seatings was a sign that this place was authentic. Opening up a mere 7 weeks ago, Scratch is owned by, not to sound oddly shocked, an Asian man who is native to France! Very neat. 

Service was pure excellent. We asked for suggestions and the waitress told us what is generally liked by males vs. females and vegetarians, too. I got the Smoked Duck Breast sandwich, and Kristin got the French Brie Cheese one, both come with organic salads (amazing vinaigrette!). Our food *promptly* arrived, yet here is when I, not on purpose, made a scene. My duck oddly smelled, looked, and tasted like Virginia ham. I told the waitress and she went back to ask the chef/owner. He immediately came out and apologized for the confusion and asked if I wanted to sample the ham to compare. I said no, but a few mins later, he still arrived with a thinly sliced of prosciutto-like Italian ham and desc. the differences. This definitely showed he cared about his customers.

Even though I enjoyed the sandwiches, they didn't blow me away and I can't see myself craving one in the future.  I needed a sauce perhaps to make it seem like less of slices of bread and good quality meat. However, I think the calorie counters may just fall in love with them, as they are pretty healthy. The people next to us tried the quiches, which Kristin said she wanted to come back to check out.

I suggest the iced coffee drinks, also. But to really top off our meal, we tried the Dark Chocolate tart (topped with fresh and candied raspberries) at the suggestion of the chef, who's fave is the elaborate Macaroon. The desserts are to die for and are so pretty, you don't wanna eat em!

Both were very annoying, and both fell during mealtime.  I went to Hissho to eat both times.

The first time, I was rushing to make my connecting flight and stopped off on Hissho to grab a roll.  There was a refrigerated section of to-go food, and the selection was pretty good - standard, sure, but a lot of options.  It took me a minute to pick an eel roll.  I ate it on the plane, and it was good.  It reminded me of the pre-packaged rolls I used to love at the cafeteria in college.  Nothing special, maybe, but satisfying.

So when I passed by Hissho in the same airport on a longer layover just a couple months later, I decided to sit down for some dinner.  I thought about getting another ready-to-go roll, but I made the mistake of opening the menu.  I had just heard Jonathan Gold review a Sinaloan sushi spot on the radio, and he said something like, ""It was good in the way chili fries are good,"" and for some reason that resulted in my ordering something called a Mango Trio.  It was an 8 piece roll with imitation crab, mango, cucumber, and mango-ginger cheese topped with salmon, tuna, and a mango habanero sauce.  I mean what the hell is mango-ginger cheese?  Anyway, the roll was edible but vaguely disgusting, with mediocre fish and an odd, goopy sauce.

My other big mistake was getting a drink.  I'm a sucker for a spicy bloody mary, and when I saw a chipotle bloody on the menu I decided to go for it.  It was the most disgusting bloody mary I've had in recent memory, very strong with a tinge of thin tomato and a bit of spice.  It had a double shot of vodka, so I guess it was at least functional.  When I got the check, though, I was shocked to see that it cost $14.  My shitty airport meal cost over $30.  Incidentally, service was also very slow.  Surprising considering the setting.

I left for my flight feeling foolish.  I would've been happier with a spicy tuna in a plastic container.  I may come back to Hissho when I fly through CLT, but I won't sit down again.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

I love the vibe of this coffee shop, and the drinks aren't too shabby either! I went with the iced shaken almond milk latte and my sister went with the coffee soda. Both drinks were really refreshing in this Vegas heat. The coffee soda especially--I've had a few of these before back in LA but they've always had a weird tart aftertaste that really didn't go well with the coffee. PublicUs's coffee soda struck a nice balance of a crisp citrus note pairing well with the coffee. 

Oh, and I also grabbed a berry muffin (because vacation means cheat weekend, right?) and tbh it was probably the best muffin I've had to date... then again, I love anything with sugar granules on top, lol. 

Will definitely be back to try the breakfast/lunch/brunch foods.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

I definitely recommend PublicUs!! The coffee was amazing! I got a death cream- it was a bit sweeter than the employee explained. But the flavors hit the spot for me. It gave me the perk up that I needed. My husband got a mocha and he enjoyed it. He says ""it's best mocha he's had."" 

The food was delicious & filling. I got the salmon toast. It wasn't on the menu, so I think it was maybe a seasonal item. I highly recommend it. My husband got the waffles- 4 waffles! He was stuffed. There are other pastries and smaller items but if your looking for brunch, coming hungry! 

I have to say the decor was a little confusing. I loved most of it. I'm impressed with the major furniture pieces- the tables, benches and art pieces.  But it's a mix between modern & there are Chinese lucky cats on most of the shelves.

I did however enjoy the cappuccino I ordered it was delicious.   They do offer a wide variety of coffee and teas.   My friend ordered the Angus beef hamburger and she said it was really good.

Several artwork displayed around the cafe. It has a casual feel where you can hang with friends and co-workers. You can see people chatting or having a meeting. 

They have two menus: a coffee menu and a meal menu with wonderful foods~ They have different menu for Breakfast, Brunch, and Lunch time. I went during lunch time with a friend. 

I always wanted to try an Avocado Toast, so I ordered the Smashed Avo Toast. Smashed Avo Toast with Sourdough bread, Avocado, a poached egg, and various vegetables. It was a light, fulfilling meal good for any time of the day. 

My friend bought the Vegan Burger, which the patty is not meat, but cooked with chickpeas, mushroom, and etc. There are also Vegan Burgers that use Black Bean to replace the meat. The Vegan Burger took a while to make, but my friend really enjoyed it. It's a very filling, healthy meal.

Besides having Vanilla Lattes, we also got a snack!  My roommate got a yummy blueberry scone and I got an excellent Pistachio Raspberry tart.  The nutty, fruity taste, combined with the sweet creamy filling, really complimented the firm crust!

We sure would go again to PublicUs since it was close to the church that we had attended.  The free parking lot and convenient restroom were bonuses!  The decor is so cool because there's so much to look at - live plants, books, toys, lanterns, map of the world, etc.  

The friendly service is great! Just order at the counter, get a number, and your order will be brought to you promptly!

Everything was incredible. Food was out of this world, so fresh, and with such attention to detail. To drink I had the a macadamia nut latte with their home made cashew milk - so so so good. To eat I had the avocado toast, poached egg, and a side of potatoes. All incredible, but the side of potatoes was otherworldly. Literally the best potatoes I've ever eaten. As if that wasn't enough food I had a slice of zucchini bread to go which was, you guessed it, SO GOOD. The perfect combo of both savory/sweet with chunks of walnuts.
On top of all that everyone who worked there was legit *radiating* pure authenticity, joy and kindness. Can't thank you guys enough for my favorite cafe experience in my 28 years of existence. Will for sure be back!","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

I seriously think I'm becoming a regular here. Haha. Cute/hot nerdy lookin' guys are the cherry on top! I have the biggest crush on this worker that told me to ""try to not work so hard today.""

I honestly did not expect this level of artistry and support from the Vegas community, so I was SO pleasantly surprised and happy to have been introduced to this by a friend of mine.

My friends and I came here today to study and we were surprised how crowded it was so early in the morning. That's when you know that this is a good spot. Because it was our first time, the staff were very friendly and helpful with answering any questions we had about the menu. We ordered at the front and found a large table for us to sit. It didn't take long for our food and coffee to come out. I ordered the mahalo plate which included spam, portuguese sausage, eggs, and rice. It also came with a side of kimchee and cucumber salad. The portion was huge and it was delicious. I also ordered a dark chocolate mocha with an extra shot of espresso and I loved it! My friends also enjoyed their coffee and food. The WiFi is fast so we had no issues logging on and staying connected while studying. Another perk about this place is that they have a big parking lot next door that is free for PublicUs customers. I definitely have to say you don't see that very often in Fremont. Although this is a great place to get work done, I do agree with the other Yelp reviews that this place needs more electrical outlets for those who want to stay longer to study and get work done. Because it's so crowded and not too many tables have access to the outlets, it was difficult to find an open table near one. Most of the electrical outlets were either located by the windows on high tables in the front or in the back corner against the wall near the restrooms. Keep in mind that the larger tables by the front have no access to the electrical outlets at all. Other than that, it's a great chill spot when you want a change of scenery from studying at home or at a typical Starbucks.

Came here for a quick brunch with my friend and service was quick enough for us to be in and out in less than 40 minutes. My friend had the brekkie burrito which she altered to be vegan (which, by the way, they are very accommodating to dietary preferences) and I had the brekkie sandwich- both were very filling and delicious!

Their vegan options are quite extensive. So far, I have tried their Freekeh Bowl, Lentil Sloppy Joe, Brekkie Burrito, and a couple of their vegan pastries. EVERYTHING I've had here has been BOMB! My favorite though is their Freekeh Bowl. I'm sure all of their drinks are great, but I just can't bring myself to try any other drinks because their Macadamia Nut Latte is AMAZEBALLS! The staff is the ""cherry on top"" of the deliciousness that they sell. They are always friendly and helpful. For example, while the cafe lacks outlets, a server stopped what he was doing to help me find one and then helped me move some items so that I could sit near that outlet. 

In my opinion, the prices are reasonable, especially given the downtown artsy neighborhood PublicUs is in. To sum it up, PublicUs gets 5 stars in every category (except number of outlets lol).","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Now, I'm writing this for imagery, but it was a cool spot and I'd sit here again if I got the chance. It was perfectly private to boot. 

We went halfsies on a chipotle chicken sandwich that was spicy and fresh. I wasn't too drawn in to a lot of the menu, but this sandwich had me hooked before and after we shared it. 

They also have proper beer glass for your pour, so it goes a step beyond typical cafe cans. Anywhere I can get coffee, lunch, and happy hour is an ideal place to put in much needed work hours. Wish I lived closer!","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

The space is located in Downtown Las Vegas in a beautiful space that is very open and inviting-once you're inside! It's very modern and has an open kitchen. They have communal tables along with some four and two top tables. You order from the front and take your number to your table.

They have a breakfast brunch menu, a drink menu, and I believe a lunch and dinner menu. Aside from different coffee drinks they sell teas and beers.

I've had their mahalo breakfast, their fried chicken, and their lentil soup. They have really nice presentation and their food all tastes very fresh. They also use really great ingredients and make a lot of things in house.

I don't live anywhere near downtown but I will make the 30-40 minute drive for their delicious brunch options, hipster coffee, and earthy decor. 

FOOD: I've only had their brunch so I can't say much about their dinner items. All their food options are instagram worthy, especially the toasts with the fruits and vegetable mixture on top. I recommend the smashed avo toast, eggs benedict, and smoked salmon toasts. 

PASTRIES: I have a huge sweet tooth so pastries are always on my mind. They serve a wide variety of scones, muffins, croissants, etc. and it's always different. I've tried the blueberry cream cheese scone (super soft and moist), strawberry brownie cookie (chewyAF but still moist), mixed berry muffin (the best muffin that you will ever eat in your life), and they are ALL DELICIOUS. 

COFFEE/DRINKS: They serve the traditional expresso drinks (latte, americano, cappuccino, etc.), iced coffee, iced tea, hot tea, and specials (like sodas). I am in love with their old fashioned coffee, macadamia nut latte, and lemon lime green tea. FYI, the baristas are always on point with their latte art --very impressive. 

AMBIANCE: They have wooden table tops/chairs, a big tree in the middle of the room, and an overall earthy vibe that is refreshing. I love the large windows, spacious seating, and appreciate the small knick knack toys everywhere.

Walking into PublicUs is like being transferred to a small oasis. The outside left more to be desired, but the inside is both eclectic and nurturing. With plenty of Chinese New Year decorations still up, it made for a festive mood, and I loved seeing all of the waving cat statues. There's an array of seating options: 2 tops, 4 tops, bar tops, benches for bigger groups, and patio tables outside. I welcomed the trees and plants that made the space feel down to earth. Really just missing a hammock, yes? 

Regrettably, I did not get the chance to order any food, all of which was expertly displayed along the counter. I got to try samples of the banana bourbon bread which was superb. The Macadamia Nut latte (with actual nutty chunks) was alright - it was quite overshadowed by the delicious Cortado special and London Fog. To date, by far, the best London Fog I have ever had!

Vegas did not let me down with PublicUs! This is definitely a casual, friendly cafe that everyone should pay a visit.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

They've never been here and we all agreed to try something new.

The cafe looks much more ""lived in"" since it's opening days when I first visited. 

It has a very eclectic but down to earth esthetic when you enter in.

The cafe and food aromas lingers enticingly as we sought out a table to eat and work from.

The staff is incredibly friendly and the food is displayed artfully.

The menu is simple and the prices are not to bad.

We ordered our food and logged into our computers, drinks arrived in a timely fashion and the food not too long after.

I order the lemon-lime green tea, not too bad, a little to citrusy for me but was good.

My fried chicken was good and spicy, the egg cooked nicely and I felt the serving was just right.

The bread pudding was amazing and delicious!

All in all, everything was good, the service was the way I remember it, the staff is attentive and the ambiance is just perfect for this neighborhood hangout.

Las note: the wifi was good!

Come, bring friends, or come hangout and meet some new friendly people.

Being from LA having access to the most eclectic versions of cafe's it's not easy to feel comfortable just anywhere, but this cafe usually has it all. My only concern is that a favorite dish of ours the last two times we frequented was very off . The Garden Benedict used to be the best, maybe it was just two very busy Sunday's that cooks couldn't handle quality control . For someone who loves runny Eggs I can definitely say they were way undercooked . I could still see the clear embryo sack of the egg. The sauce on the spinach was nowhere as good as the previous 5 visits. My man and I even brought our Business partner. He got the same thing And barely touched it. The girl at the register as I was trying to explain the awesome special start to finish process of their gourmet coffee did not chime in even when I lured her with questions to peak the curiosity of our business partner in the interest of quality .

And I'm definitely *not* one of those ""let's hang out in a coffee shop all afternoon with our laptops and enjoy a lavender latte"" kind of gal. Quite the contrary!

Not that there's anything wrong with TCOB'ing in a cool cafe with flavored coffee drinks. You gotta do you.

I like PublicUs because it highlights everything cool about Las Vegas that one doesn't expect. The downtown location with parking is just the tip of the iceberg. An artsy, but low key vibe sets the mood. Really, really nice people behind the counter. Healthy food options. Plenty of seating. Clean bathrooms. There's even the occasional Las Vegas celebrity sighting.

What you won't find at PublicUs? Tons of outlets for your laptop chargers. House music. Topless dancers. Snotty baristas. Milkshakes with giant pieces of cheesecake on top. And frankly, there's plenty of that elsewhere in Sin City.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

They also had a surprisingly hefty menu for breakfast. You order up at the counter and are given a number to bring back to your seat. Alongside the counter is where they prepare the meals/coffee and you could pick from their assorted display of pastries as well. The decor inside this place is just beautiful with bookshelves of books lining one wall and a long communal table with trees growing out of the middle. Seemed really modern and hipster. Very aesthetically nice to have a coffee or meal at. 

For breakfast, I ordered the garden farm breakfast ($13), while my parents and sister got the steak and eggs, which comes with potatoes and toast ($14); the traditionalist, which comes with spam, two eggs, sausage, and potatoes ($11), and the brekkie sandwich, which had two eggs, bacon, avocado, and chedder between a toasted brioche bun ($10) with two iced coffees. The garden farm breakfast came with a beautifully poached eggs over a bed of swiss chard with baby carrots, asparagus, potatoes, tomatoes, and a couple pieces of toasted bread. The vegetables made the plate so colorful and bright! The meal was light and fresh but really hearty and satisfying at the same time. Such a healthy and nutritious way to start off the day. I tried a few bites of each of the other dishes and I could say the same quality of food is found in all the meals, all freshly made with great ingredients and delicious flavor combinations. 

Definitely a pleasant surprise to find all this place has to offer. Very cute decor and really delicious breakfast foods!","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

My friend and I dropped into Public Us Restaurant today for some grub and catch up! I didn't realize how far east this place is located from DTLV (it's closer to Maryland Pwkwy). 

After awkwardly waiting at the door for a few minutes I walked over to the espresso bar and asked for some help. 

The restaurant is cozy and very unique. The cafeteria style theme was a bit different from what I'm used to and I held the line up with all my questions which was a bit annoying I'm sure for the regulars but oh well. The cashier appeared frustrated by all my questions but that's to be expected with the style of restaurant. 

I ordered:

Pesto Soft Scramble W/ Egg Whites $12
Highly recommend!!! 

Side of potatoes: The potatoes were amazing. Very crunchy and delish! 

Lemon Lime Green Tea (Terrible NOT recommended! It's sooo tart and had to be diluted.)

The service is always stellar, and the cafe is absolutely beautiful.  My partner and I decided to order a few things and split them.  We started with a ham and cheese croissant, which was just that.  The croissant was dry and uber-flaky - it definitely needed some sort of spread to moisten it up.  I did enjoy how the ham was crisped on the edges, but the sandwich wasn't warmed enough.  The middle was cold, and the cheese was hardly melted.  The waffles were tasty and abundant, and the veggie frittata was my favorite - eggs fluffy,with a great, fresh vegetable mix, and the crust was moist and flaky (in the good way).  The portions are large and in charge.  I also had to get the macadamia nut latte again.  I really wish it came in larger sizes - it's really my new favorite latte. One thing worth noting is that when I noticed that their silverware bar was out of knives, they were quick to respond and replenish the missing utensils with a smile.

The design is great, very hipster and earthy and its everything!

Not a waiter service type of place more like a coffee shop or small cafe style where you order and pay at the register then pick your seats. You grab your own water in the water area and your own silverware and then they bring you whatever you ordered.

They have local baked goods and coffee for the person on the go and they have full meals and Mimosas for the brunchers.

We both decided to order ""The Traditionalist"" which came with your choice of bacon, Turkey bacon, spam or sausage, two eggs, toast, and beautifully cooked fried potatoes.

No seriously, if you could wrap up everything I love in one place, this would be it. 

The bff Amelinda L. brought me in on one of my trips back to Vegas, and it was just incredible. We ordered a couple coffee drinks (one was a pour-over of the Geisha blend/type, the second was the espresso Old Fashioned), and amongst the two (teehee) of us, we split three tartines and a slice of their quiche. As a somewhat self-described bread snob (I've recently been baking sourdough bread, SF Tartine style), the sourdough was tasty and the toppings were thoughtfully put on and well-seasoned. Everything was also reasonably priced. Service was attentive and just-right, as Goldilocks would say. 

As far as ambiance goes, it's a perfect blend of being quiet without being too quiet, although to be fair, I went on a weekday morning versus rush hour times. Beautiful furniture and artwork completed the experience for me. There is some faux greenery around, as well as beautifully constructed furniture and probably one of the nicest bathrooms in Las Vegas. 

Would gladly recommend this (and I have been) to anyone who visits Vegas. Truly one hell of a place.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

My boyfriend and I were greeted by the friendly cashier. When he found out it was our first time, he happily jumped to our side and explained the food and beverage menus to us. I got the iced macadamia nut paste latte with almond milk, and my boyfriend got the shaken almond latte. We sat down with our table number and took a moment to look around. 
The tables by the windows each had a tree at the center of them. There were a bunch of other tables scattered throughout the place without it looking clustered or messy. Our drinks came out; however, my boyfriend wanted to add syrup to his, and the cashier gave it to us for free rather than charging us like most places (yay!). Both of our drinks were delicious, I would recommend the macadamia nut paste latte the way it is and the shaken almond latte (with vanilla syrup)

PublicUs (pronounced similarly to Spartacus) is an order-then-sit cafe located on Fremont St, but well off the hustle and bustle of the main part of downtown and with an ample parking lot in the back. They're open from morning until evening. We went here mainly for the coffee, and we also had some desserts, but we didn't sample anything savory today.

I had The Cannon ($4.50), which is iced coffee with lime, lime bitters, and house simple syrup. It sounded intriguing and tasted every bit as good as I'd hoped. It's very similar to a lemon-honey tea, but with coffee instead. I can see why they have a plaque for 1st place in the America's Best Coffeehouse Competition (specifically, 2015 Western Region Champions).

My friends shared some desserts with me, namely the warmed bread pudding ($6.00) and the ""Black Forest"" mousse ($?.??). The bread pudding was definitely among the better ones that I've had, with not too mushy a texture and nice spice. However, I would pick that chocolate mousse over the bread pudding any day. Although I didn't really detect the requisite cherry other than the one used as a garnish, the mousse itself was smooth, balanced in sweetness, and rich in chocolate. The cherry was perhaps an accent flavor at best.

It turned to be a very nice place to sit down and enjoy coffee with friends, and I would have been just as comfortable bringing a laptop as other folks did, or sitting down to eat something savory (although other reviewers suggest that those menu items may be less successful). I loved hearing the songs from bands such Interpol, Arcade Fire, and twenty one pilots. Definitely much more my vibe than the stereotypical coffee house music.

If nothing else, PublicUs is an excellent place for coffee and pastries, and I hope to be back soon to try more of their specialty coffee drinks.

[QUICK UPDATE 2/10/16: Stopped by intending to get coffee. Eventually decided on the Espresso Old-Fashioned ($5.00) to-go. Halfway through the drink, I finally had enough caffeine in my system to realize that the employee had described this as the one served with a huge ice sphere, which wouldn't have fit in the to-go cup and therefore was replaced with other ice. I don't think the effect was lost though, and I'd definitely order it again but not to-go. I felt like I was having a cocktail but with an espresso base. Note that the drink's size is cocktail-like too.]","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Today we order an Espresso Old Fashioned, and the Lemon-lime iced green tea. Both ""mock tails"" were amazing! The presentation for the espresso old fashioned is very creative and is really seems as though your having the real deal.

I was greeted as soon as I walked in by a friendly host/server and had my choice of tables as I was one of three ppl dining for lunch. As a solitary diner, I am always a bit put off by an empty dining room or awkward environment but I shrugged it off as another culinary adventure. Glad I did. While the dining room is (as some reviewers pointed out) empty and random like a ""temporary cafe"", I kind of dug it. I'm not a food snob by any means but I appreciate good food from an unassuming place. Soon after being seated I was offered potato skins, which I declined due to personal taste but they did smell good. I had a few moments to look around and the decor was almost there but just too random. Almost like a studio apt decorated by a guy with good ideas but no clue about style, design & placement. The lunch menu was short and sweet and I was torn between the Brie Grilled Cheese and the Grilled Chicken Panini. Based on the recommendation from my friendly server, I choose the panini. Since I was one of very few ppl, my lunch came out quickly and was presented beautifully. Fries were my chosen side and unfortunately a bit too greasy and floppy if you know what I mean (I always prefer them crunchy!). My sandwich was DELICIOUS (Hence the 3 stars)! Perfectly grilled chicken on yummy warm crispy bread and melty cheese and veggies. Super flavorful and not greasy. 
While the atmosphere isn't anything to write home about, my lunch was great. I WILL be back to try something new! 
**side note** I asked my server how long they'd been open and to my surprise he said about 2 yrs. The business was orig started as a catering company and the cafe opened as a ancillary part of the biz due great response. With a few minor adjustments, this place could totally take off.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Here are a few:

Citrus Salad with Pork Bellies 
Polish Plate - Homemade peirogies, Kielbasa with Sauerkraut & Potato Pancakes   
Bacon, Egg & Provolone Burger
California Wrap  
Brie Grilled Cheese w/ Roasted Tomato Soup
Bread Pudding with Bourbon Caramel

In a part of town often overlooked by locals & tourists a like, sits this cozy little cafe tucked away from the glam & shine of the vegas lights. Unappealing on the outside, the restaurants exemplifies with what it hides within.

Simplicity shines & the feeling of something real envelopes your sense & whet's the appetite for what is to come. The polish plate had definitely struck home, as its flavors generously envelopes the buds. Oh as they long for more of the pan fried sauerkraut, that layers itself on top of the kielbasa. A seismic tremor of homely indulgence that emanate from the pierogies.

The bold richness of the roasted tomato soup, subdues the cold chill of the day & warms the oven of the body, as the tang beckons you for more.

The hostess, warm & welcoming, the chef hospitable to great lengths as bringing me the aromatic soup himself. Kudos.

Snapping back to reality, the potato pancakes were a slight let down, in terms of complimentary side dish, but still good nonetheless. I couldn't quite relate to the ambiance, maybe it was the lighting but that's just me.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

They are currently running a $2.22 breakfast special with two eggs, two pieces of meat (sausage, bacon, ham, spam), hash browns, and 2 pancakes. I don't think I could make breakfast for that cheap. It's really good. They also have daily $5 lunch specials. The portions are always great, and the style of food runs the gamut. The food is always fresh and healthy tasting.

The bed was cozy and comfortable, the bathroom was sleek and functional, and I loved the giant tub in the room. I used it to soothe my aching muscles after using a Bixi bike to climb Mont Royal.

I also really liked that the bed is a murphy bed; if you push it up into the wall, you reveal several little ottomans and a bench so you could potentially have a little shindig in this hotel room, which is actually more like a studio apartment.

The very texture of the milk was outstanding. Simply outstanding. I came back after a linch at the Merigold and had a latte again with a different blend of espresso. The second blend had a floral lemon flavor to it. Usually I HATE lemon profiles in my coffee/dairy, but this was totally rocking my world. I did notice that the acidity took away the foam on my latte much fast (how strange).

However, even if wasn't steps from my residence, I would still swing in here often due to convenient street and off-street parking options (parking garage or children's museum). 

The coffee here is pretty damn good, and if you're a moderate coffee-drinker like me, it's potency will have you set for the rest of the morning. If you're going to eat here, I recommend going with any of their sweet or savory crepes that they're known for. I was hooked on the Dark Chocolate and Door County Cherry crepe for the longest time... but it has not been on the menu the past month or so. I inquired with the fella behind the counter and he told me they had some issues with a few cherry batches recently, so they pulled it off until they can get the cherry supply issue resolved. I hope it comes back soon!

After you get your coffee, don't expect to have lots of elbow room or a place to spread a newspaper out - the seating area is tiny and cramped.

But hey, this is Madison - it's impossible to avoid here. I love the 2-seater table they set outside at the corner of their cafe.. however, it's tough to claim unless you get there early in the morning (like I do)!

Speaking of hipsters, the people working behind the counter probably fall into that category as well, but I don't find them to be snooty as some other reviewers have indicated. Unless they're busy, I've always found them to be courteous, friendly and smiley. Wait times are reasonable considering the crepes are all made-to-order.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

(Who knew one base dish could be so many things!) The crêpes are also served with a keen eye for presentation, often with a lovely garnish or side salad tied to the crêpe's main ingredient.

The staff are creative chefs, and they are always willing to suggest a tasty vegetarian substitution (though at least one of the savory crepes on the menu is always vegetarian). Last night, for example, I liked the sound of the sprouted lentil and fried egg crêpe that also contained bacon, and the barista suggested substituting the yogurt cheese for the meat.

Considering that it's not a tiny space, I wished the cafe had one or two bigger tables rather than the singular round ones. Usually when arriving to a cafe I have yet to review, I would ask the barista right away if I could do a interview. The barista said if it could be done quickly because she wanted to get back to chatting with her father since she never had the time to spend it with him. Although she wasn't outright rude, I found this to be off-putting because I was the one and only customer there at the time. She had plenty of time to speak with her father, which she did afterwards when she was done with my order. Being from a business background, you don't tell a customer to hurry up because you have something else you want to do that is not related to work. That just gives a customer a bad image of your company.

Rant aside, I did quite enjoy the chai latte I ordered. It was a bit too much on the sweetness but I rather have it sweet than not. When I came back again a few days later, I ordered the same drink again because it really appealed to the sweet tooth in me.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Pretty impressive.
 I have been to Grinder Coffee before, and remembered too late that I'd had an Americano on my previous visit as well. Sadly I didn't love it then or now - a bit too thin for my taste - but I would definitely return and try something else. 
The bench on the sidewalk in front of the cafe features a silhouette of a person sitting, arms outstretched, as if enjoying the chance to watch the world go by. It's a quirky introduction to a very nice cafe.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

I just moved to this area and LOVE this place!!! Amazing amazing coffee and I LOVE the cheeky signs on the coffee. The decor is amazingly cute and cozy - It's the only place I am actually digging the holiday display style. Music is amazing, staff is super friendly and atmosphere is great. Everyone who goes there is really friendly - it's like the Cheers of cafes. Although noone knows each other, everyone talks to each other and people were going out for smokes together - cute! Haven't tried a fancy espresso drink yet, but was super super happy to find out that they don't charge extra for soy milk. They have a huge selection of baked nomnoms, even some gluten-free ones. Their baked goods come from an independent bakery in Prine Edward County. But, sadly, nothing vegan! The owner said that they had tried carrying vegan items AND almond milk and noone wanted either! So make sure if you go there that you ask for vegan gluten-free yummies so that they know there's a demand.

Ways they could get 5 stars:
- vegan, gluten-free nom noms (obv)
- ditch the gross pink soap in the bathroom and get some bonners or something in a nice soap dispenser (not sure why, but this bugged me!)
- the fridge makes me sad. It needs to be smaller or just better stocked - add some things that are more fun, like kombucha or coconut water or something!

In response to other reviews: They have since gotten WiFi and have updated their decor.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Ultimately, however, I just don't like it.

My reasons:
(1) The decor is cold and shoddily done. They do not provide towels or a hand drier for the washroom sink (which, by the way, is not actually in the washroom). Plywood bench mentioned by previous poster is uncomfortable and too high for tables. Tables are wobbly. Whole place has a spit-and-glue appearance that is maybe supposed to be charming but comes off as slipshod.

(2) Maybe I'm completely imagining this, but I've gotten a weird vibe here. The staff is absolutely friendly, but I get the impression that they are vying for a certain clientele (DINK condo-dwellers and the like) and they roll out an over-the-top brand hospitality for those who fit the profile. It seems to me that they're trying (too hard) to be an upscale cafe in a still-rough-around-the-edges neighbourhood. Pretension in this neck of the woods is kind of ridiculous. And lest you think I'm bitter, I pretty much fit the profile and was extended said hospitality--it just felt fake.

(3) The prices are silly. More than $4 for a latte and the same price for a hot chocolate. This I could forgive if the lattes were fantastic, but... 

(4) The latte and Americano were both weak and unpleasantly bitter. Absolutely not worth $4.22. (Not rounding prices to the nearest number is another pet peeve of mine.) More expensive than most other indie places in the city. Ones that actually serve quality espresso drinks. Have you been to Sam James? They make a $3.25 latte that kicks this latte's ass into the next millennium.

Boil it down to personal preference, I suppose, but Grinder rubs me the wrong way.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

My boyfriend's Americano was great and the cider was fantastic - not too sugary and extremely appley.  Also loved the giant cinnamon stick.  I wondered if the prices were out of the price range of people in the neighbourhood.  

Decor has to be slightly worked on - not a lot of comfy places to sit, and I can't really understand the giant plywood board at the front of the store with pillows - it seems highly uncomfortable, even with the pillows.  

I'm not a regular cafe wifi user and am not in the hood, but I can see what other users mean by the lack of wifi and  the times being super inconvenient.  I do like, however, the TV showing when the next TTC streetcar is coming, that was a highly courteous addition.... hope they can extend that to their hours and wifi coverage.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

I've had Coco in the past in both Canada and Taiwan but it was never a place I regularly came for bubble tea. It was my first time at this location and my first time ordering their winter melon tea (honestly my staple, now). It's located with other stores to create something like a mini food court, which I think is cool but it loses its coziness as a cafe. The line was long, but I think the cashier did try to her best get through everyone quickly (it's probably a popular location due to its proximity to Eaton's Centre and Ryerson). I'm quite surprised by my drink considering the tea is quite flavourful, I could probably have lessen my sugar level since it was 100%, as it's quite sweet even for a sweet tooth like me; however, the grass jelly goes well with the drink with every sip!","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

When I asked about their iced tea, he explained the Hippie Blend, saying it has a few herbal teas, one being chamomile. The price was cheap. I decided to try it and added peach flavor syrup for a little extra sweetness, which I don't think he charged me for.

A friend and I got dirty chais. Promptly were asked if we want whole milk or a substitute which was great since I'm lactose intolerant. The chai was served hot and tasted great. Not to sweet and not too bitter.

The yogurt and fresh fruit are served in prepackaged cups, but the sandwiches come out hot. The server was even nice enough to ask if I was okay to eat cheese since I asked for a non-dairy substitute in my drink.

When I asked about whether they made the cake pops in house, the barista chuckled and said ""They'd be twice the price if we did"" and then confessed that they buy them through a distributer. Nonetheless, the quality is good. The cake is moist, and the chocolate covering it is rich. I ordered the Chicken Caprese Wrap with a side salad which absolutely blew me away! Lots of great basil flavor and a balsamic vinaigrette seasoning. For the price, this has got to be the best cafe food downtown.

As for the chai latte? It was good. Its a powder mix and it's a little on the sweet side. Nothing super impressive but tolerable in the end.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Also worth mentioning, the WiFi is abhorrent. Connection is too weak in all areas of the restaurant to even display text.

I don't know if it was a purposeful way to boot campers out. I've never had this happen to me at a cafe.

Aroma didn't disappoint their version of the Cuban very close to the Miami one. Everything else terrific.

I'm a Champaign local, have tried all the other cafes downtown and by far Aroma is my favorite. You can't beat the atmosphere, great smiles from the staff, amazing music selection and drink options.

Some of the food can be a bit expensive, but once you bite into your first toasted Reuben or Cuban sandwich, it's totally worth it.

Their bagel special or their breakfast sandwiches  for breakfast/ brunch after a long night ( don't forget the coffee ) make Aroma a great place for breakfast too.

I've played board games, studied, worked remotely, met people to catch up etc. all at this little great cafe. Love it, sometimes I don't know where I'd be without a coffee of the day and a smile, and I know I'll find that everytime at Aroma.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Their atmosphere is perfect for studying, reading, or simply grabbing a bite to eat and people-watching. The purple ambiance is comfortable, and the local artists' work on the walls (which are available for purchase) add a personal touch.

Both the roast beef wrap and mango chicken wrap were fresh and light with a good mix of flavors. The cream cheese is from local sources which you can clearly taste from the first bite. The sides of salad and fruit were both fresh and flavorful.

*See edit*
I'm addicted to the vanilla chai, but I really go there for the raspberry white chocolate scones. I challenge you to find a better scone in the world! Okay, well, maybe not the world, but they trump any pastry in every coffee shop I've ever visited. When I've been on the road, this is the first place I come back to. Aroma is home!

Also, the salsa here is amazing. It is house-made and there are two kinds: try the one with the peaches. I get it as a side with my cheese quesadilla, which is also tasty and totally worth spending my lunch money on!

Edit: 5/20/2012
Since I last reviewed Aroma, it has gone through a lot of changes, including new ownership. What's bad about this is they took away almost every single thing I loved. Those unparalleled raspberry white chocolate scones? Gone. Now they serve bloated English scones from Sweet Indulgences that are as dry and tasteless as the Sahara. Massive, extraordinary fail. I mean, there used to be epic Scone Wars over Aroma's scones--I used to try to beat these elderly ladies who worked downtown to the cafe to get my share. For real. Now the new scones just sit on a plate, untouched and unwanted, fat blobs of loathing. Anybody who likes them never had the original, heavenly scones of old. They're not even in the same category of pastry, I tell you. They offer other pastries from Sweet Indulgences, too, but they're all really expensive and not what I would eat for breakfast. (Old habits die hard.) They still sell apple fritters, I guess.

They tried to get rid of my beloved chai, as well, but then the new baristas were too mentally challenged to make bagged chai tea and they had to revert back to the mix. I guess leaving a tea bag in a cup of steamed milk requires too much comprehension. I'm glad for it, anyway, because if natural bagged chai is your thing, nobody in town is better than Kopi, which is just around the block. Competing against them is just a waste of time, so they're safer to keep the chai mix and go with what their customers already know and love.

Also, that amazing peach salsa? Yup, it's gone now, too. Forever. The whole menu has been revamped to have fancier, slightly healthier offering. I haven't been desperate enough to try any of their new food items except for the fruit salad, which is basically a bowl of chopped fruit with a yummy syrup over it, and that was good, but it was just for breakfast. I will say they seem to have spared most of their old menu's wraps and other lunch items for the time being. The Wi-Fi is also password-protected now (""sexytoast"" is the key). 

At least they didn't insert that proposed ""kid corner"" they threatened us with earlier during the revamp. That would've sent me running for the hills instantly. As someone who comes in here regularly to find quiet and write, I can tell you the very last thing I want is to share space with a corner of screaming, running toddlers. 

I deducted Aroma a star for all of this, but find it hard to give it less than 4 stars. I've been coming to Aroma for seven years, so I think of it as my home away from home, even if it currently is a shell of what it once was. Some of the other regular customers I used to see in here are thinning out. I guess all of this will make it easier for when I move from Champaign, because now it's just depressing.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

They have lots of seating indoors (including some cushy chairs by a fireplace in the back), and something I especially appreciated was the abundance of outlets!  There's nothing more frustrating than getting to a cafe that either a) has wireless, but you gotta pay for it, or b) has free wireless, but only two outlets for the patrons to fight over.

After ordering my hummus plate, I grabbed a table by the wall, plugged myself in, connected to the free internet, and spent a nice evening relaxing....  at least that's what I would've liked to have said.  I was actually scrambling to finish an assignment before they closed up for the day, haha.  The warm pita bread and fresh, crisp cucumbers that came with the hummus was very tasty though =)

I've never been to a restaurant like this before. It's actually a little hard to describe. There are two places to eat. There's a cafe and a grill. I'm really not sure if there's a difference. We were going to go to the cafe but the line was really long so we went to the grill. This required walking through the outside areas and gave me a chance to take in the whole place. There are community farm plots outside and several interesting outdoor eating spaces. The coolest was one around a massive oak tree. 

The restaurant is in an old converted house and some dining areas still look like a 50s-style ranch--which I think is pretty cool. Anyway, on to the food. I had the Huevos de Farm Grill which was good but not exactly what I was expecting. It's scrambled eggs with pulled pork, beans and fried tortillas. It was good but I didn't expect the pork to be mixed in with the eggs. My husband had the breakfast tacos and they were really good. Everything was fresh and delicious. Nothing tasted processed or fake. I'd definitely go back for the food but probably on a cooler day so I could sit out by the oak. The drawbacks are that you eat on plastic plates, which somewhat ruins the whole eco-friendly vibe, and the bathrooms are outside. The bathrooms are really cool. They have Barbie and GI Joe dolls encased in backlit shadow boxes. They really went for the 50s nostalgia. It feels like you're in a spaceship. However, I just really don't like going outside to use the toilet unless I'm sitting outside. 

Like I said, this was overall a great experience and I would definitely go back the next time I'm visiting my family in Arizona.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

The menu has healthy options, local ingredients, and is very tasty! The history of the building (at one time a house/residence) is cool too. There is indoor and outdoor seating, which is really nice during the cooler months in AZ. The set up is different than many restaurants. It seems to me to be a hybrid of a cafeteria and a restaurant - definitely casual. 
Patrons wait in line (snakes around and out the door like an amusement park) to place their order at the window. Laminated menus are provided for perusal while in line. Once the order at the window is placed & paid for, then seats and drinks are next. Seating inside is limited to a side room that seats approx 40-50 and a long pub height table near the line to order. Additional seating is located outside in a ""back yard"" with shade trees, picnic tables and some tables with chairs. Soda fountains are also located outside. 
The ordering and pick up area for the food tends to get congested. There seems to always be a line...which is a testament to the food! It's a local favorite. Family friendly. Healthy and flavorful options. Price range is $10-$15 per person (including beverage). On your birthday bring your ID and they'll give $10 toward your meal for your birthday!!

During the course of my sister's stay at a hospice close to this location, I was a regular patron here for a few weeks.  Family from out of town were excited because of Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives so I spent much time here.  TWO stars for service:  when I double checked my $140 carry out order, about five items were missing (no apologies, only excuses).  My aunt had problems a few days earlier with a partial dine in order.  On a separate occasion, I only got an order of onion rings to go because I had just eaten at the cafe.  My cousin's were so tasty, I had to get some for my hubby.  I had to ask about them after 15 minutes of waiting (with no line and an empty dining room) and at least this time I got an apology and an excuse as I watched them drop my forgotten rings in the fryer.  BUT the coffee shop gets five stars for service and food!  Very courteous and knowledgeable!  Love the prairie bread that was recommended for my club!  Because all the food is so delicious and deserves TEN stars, but the service left me hanging, I gave this place three stars.  The girls that take the orders are very courteous, the people that shove the  food at you are the ones who need to work on their people skills.  I will more than likely eat here again when I make it to the east valley because the food is just that tasty!

  If I was forced to choose: I'd rather get ten star food with 2 star service than phenomenal service with a bowl of poop. 

 Favorites:
Sweet Potato pie, Onion rings, Asian salad with seared ahi (FYI: the ahi is pre-seared and served cold atop the salad), RIBS ARE OUTRAGEOUS, milkshakes, Mexican coca colas, burgers.... Basically it is ALL AMAZING  The whoopie pies at the cafe are scrumptious!  And anything on prairie bread!!

There was no real wait to speak of, nothing like I expected and nothing more than I typically find in some of our favorite spots back home. My wife got a huge Thai chicken salad easily enough for two to share, father in-law was pleased with the shrimp plate, mother in-law had the bbq pork and also could have shared I felt it would have been a good size. My kids had grilled cheese and corn dog basket, one had sweet potato fries and they were tasty, the other regular fries, I had the veggie burger which is a huge patty of black beans and other veggies with onion rings, I went home stuffed! 

Wide range of fountain drinks and some bottles of soda and water when you walk in, but the fresh squeezed lemonade is a must in the hot Phoenix sun, or the tasty chocolate milkshake will do as well. 

Behind the main entrance we found a nice patio with plenty of shade, and a nice cafeteria style setting.

I have tried to like this place but honestly very over rated 
They could really decrease the wait time by opening another window and getting customers seated would be a huge plus!!
Yes it's a different experience but not a good one!
I'm changing the 1 star rating to a 3 star only because we have been back here several times with people who insist and luckily we came on a tues at 8am so there are no lines! 
Food still okay at best but a 1 star may be unfair and I think 2 may be reserved for worse places also.
I still will not be back at peak times to sit in long long lines","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Yes, they have onion rings, fries, and burgers, but they are so much better than what you are picturing. Nothing tastes old and stale. It all comes out hot and fresh. The building itself is pretty interesting, considering it used to be a home, then it was converted into a business. Be prepared to wait in line, because this place is always busy for lunch and dinner. Finding a spot to sit isn't too hard, but it is another place that has a 'cafeteria style' seating arrangement. I had a grilled cheese the last time I visited, and onion rings. Yummy. I know it's hard to mess up a grilled cheese, but you would be surprised- this one was delicious. I was happy to see that Joe's was on television too. This place really deserves the popularity. The staff is friendly too. Thanks Joe. :-)","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

I LOVE Joe's BBQ in downtown Gilbert and have often ordered from there for parties I have had.  Joe's Farm Grill was a bit disappointing.  30 dollars for 1 soda, and two meals at lunch time, we waited in a cafeteria type line for about 20 minutes.  Only one order window open.  Several employees in back messing around.  We ordered the ahi tuna and the chicken BBQ pizza, both featured on the Food Network.  The tuna came out first and we had to wait another 5 minutes for the BBQ pizza.  The tuna was so fatty that my husband could only eat about 4 bites.  He said flavor was good but quality of meat not good.  The BBQ pizza was so bland, chicken (very little chicken) was dried out.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Funny, it was literally down the street from where I used to live...I had driven by it many times, and never noticed it.

Joe's is situated in a unique futuristic-like building, next to a little cafe/coffee shop on the same property. Once inside Joe's, we were able to order pretty quickly despite the crowd. I had bbq chicken pizza, which was fantastic! My fiance had one of their burgers, which I had a few bites of. Both meals were very tasty, fresh, and light. Although it was a little on the spendy side, it was worth it because everything was obviously fresh and healthier than your average eatery.

We really enjoyed our lunch and checking out the grounds, and I hate to complain, but I did have 2 questions. First, the restroom set-up was strange (only 1 restroom, in which you have to wait in line for outside), and you have to go outside to get drink refills...next to the lone restroom (which was strange to me). Just a funky set-up. But otherwise, the visit was great, and we will be back for another meal and visit to their coffee shop.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

It's cafeteria style, so there usually a long line around lunchtime on the weekends. Don't let that deter you because it moves pretty fast. You order at the window and they give you a buzzer when your food is ready to be picked up at the next window.

The food is fresh and really really good! The sweet potato fries came out very crispy, sweet and moist inside. I hat the onion rings with a crunchy corn meal batter. The buffalo chicken sandwich is really good too. The bun is a soft sweet roll and it comes with this dressing that had huge chunks of blue cheese. Amazing. Everyone's food was awesome.

I had the house special bbq chicken pizza which has a ton of flavor and a nice grilled thin crispy crust. Mmmm. Highly recommended! Wifey and mom had salad which was fine. Supposedly they grow everything on site in their farm so the veggies are always fresh. 

Overall the food is good, nothing spectacular but its definitely good. Service was friendly, which is very important to me!

They have picnic tables outside you can eat on, which is nicer than the plasticky 'school cafeteria' furniture thats inside.

The cole slaw was disappointing though because it had absolutely no flavor.  I don't like much mayo in my slaw but it still wasn't flavorful enough.  The sweet potato fries were so very good.  They are nice and crispy.  The sauce that came with it was a little too sweet for me so I made my own garlic aioli sauce to dip.  Using mayo, the garlic from my garlic fries and a package of lemon juice they provide.  I really like the idea of the packaged lemon juice since I heard slices of lemon wedges can be really unsanitary.  I also tried the bbq bacon blue burger and it was tasty.  All ingredients are Joe's are really fresh.  I didn't know this but I could have substituted (probably for more $$$ though) my slaw with any fries.

Service is just ok. Food is horrible. Expensive for what you get. Most Mexican restaurant give you 2 enchiladas for the price of their 1, in a meal. And it tastes awful. 

First time I got chicken fajitas. The chicken was all gross pieces I wouldn't even serve to a dog. And they only give you two wraps. Had to pay extra for a third wrap. 

Second time I got a chicken fajita salad. Came out with rotten brown avocados and shredded dark meat chicken. NOT fajita chicken (grilled breast). 
Fail. Sent it back for a chimi and got beans inside because their meat looks shady. It wasn't great and the lettuce in the plate was brown and rotten. 

Toddler got a cheese crisp. It comes with fries and *only* fries, and don't try to substitute! And you pay $6 for a tiny cheese crisp (they're free at cafe rio, btw...). Asked for sour cream in place of fries. Nope, extra $1.00. So now we are up to $7.00 for a cheap and terrible kids meal. Fail.

and many are for purchase.

So food was decent here. Why two stars only, you may wonder? 

Reason was the cleanliness of the food court: actually last time I was coming for the rice noodle rolls at Da Ke Yi in the same food court, it wasn't that bad. But this time it was so gross I was able to remember clearly; there was uncleaned food mess on most tables and I could see oil dripping down the waste bin in front of me while I was eating. It was that disgusting. Wish I took a picture of it for Yelpers to see.

Very unfortunate as the food is actually not bad, and the main point of my review is not meant to be critical of the food quality from the particular food joint.

It is not heavily spiced, so it will not offend those who prefer food on the blander side, although a bit more spice would have suited me.

Though we had a young man make our food one time and he didn't ask us of our diet options and put ingredients our diet cannot have. Knowing that it must have been a mistake, they replaced our food but only half of it.. Not very happy about it.

I actually didn't expect to like this place that much since I'm not much of a health food junkie (I'm more of a fried chicken and biscuits gal) but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate a well crafted salad once in a while. 

First thing- this place is on Playhouse Square, which is great if you're in the area anyways, but if you're driving her with the express purpose of grabbing a quick lunch, parking will most definitely be an issue, so factor that in your plans. 

First impression- the restaurant is split into a ""take out"" side with a small window bar for waiting, and an eat in/ dining side, which is really tastefully decorated, and because it's on the corner across from Starbucks, it has a lovely view of Playhouse Square and the new(ish) chandelier. 

I was greeted immediately by a girl, even though it was past the typical lunch hour, around 2:30pm. She showed me the menu, and I asked her for some recommendations which she kindly shared with me, but she didn't hover waiting for me to order which I appreciated, especially considering I was the only one in the restaurant at that time. I think the thing that impressed me the most is the sheer diversity of options on their menu. They serve breakfast all day long (and being the breakfast lover that I am, I was really tempted to go with this option) but I ended up choosing one of their specials written on the blackboard nearby. I ordered a black bean burger with oven baked fries, along with one of their ""ginger get well"" drinks. If you're at all a ginger lover like myself, you will LOVE the ginger get well drink- it's not overly spicy like a lot of ginger beers, but still really flavorful and served cold and frothy almost like a smoothie, but not as thick. 

The black bean burger was homeade, which made me really happy since many times when you order a black bean burger in a restaurant, you get one of those Morning Star patties and then ask yourself why you couldn't have just made yourself that at home. But their black bean burger was clearly made in house- served on a multigrain bun with sprouts and tomatoes. The oven baked ""fries"" that came with it were really crispy and not oily at all. 

Most of all, the girl serving me was an absolute sweetheart! I was really impressed at the quality of service I received, as well as the value of my meal. I would say this place's prices are comparable to Panera bread, but much better quality ingredients and way better experience obviously. 

I can't wait to recommend this place to my  vegetarian friends, and even those that aren't vegetarian or even health conscious would enjoy this place in my opinion. I'm eager to go back when I have the chance to try out more things on their menu, and experience Phuel cafe all over again!","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

We started with the veg nosh board which was awesome!! The cauliflower was not gf so I did not have it but my guys loved it. It came on a bed of quinoa which was simple but good. The kale pakoras were excellent and crispy, the Brussels sprout chips were crunchy and flavourful and the edamame was mildly flavoured but delicious. The pakoras and Brussels sprouts had an aioli type sauce with them. 
Unfortunately, beyond these apps there was nothing else for me to order. I even went down to their little cafe to see if I could have anything from there but everything else that was vegetarian had dairy in it. Luckily it was still happy hour so I got another order of the pakoras and Brussel sprouts for $5 each. The problem was that all these items were deep fried and I felt nauseous after.
Hubby had the ribs but couldn't eat the Mac and cheese with it. My son enjoyed his shrimp.
Hubby enjoyed 2 drinks for $6 each during happy hour which ends promptly at 6pm. 
For dessert we shared the only gf, vegan dessert...the pumpkin cheesecake. I was not a fan....it was dense and tasted ok, but did not satisfy my sweet tooth.

The only thing that stood out to any of us were the sweet potato chips that came with the sandwich. They were great. 

We actually commented that we were glad we were not working that day...lunch took almost 2 hours. Maybe just a bad day???

The only breakfast item they had was the breakfast panini and it couldn't be modified because it was already made.  I completely understand the idea of having things pre made so that it's a quick process which is their concept here.  What I am not understanding is pre making everything and keeping it for days and if you are out on a Sunday wouldn't you prep Monday morning?  I got a breakfast panini and a bowl of soup it was ok.

And it never ceases to amaze me how a ""professional"" cook/chef(?) can turn a perfectly good chicken breast into an inedible, dry piece of shoe leather and call it ""blackened"".

You have to turn up a street that looks like you are going to a residential area before you get there and then it is tucked into a strip mall.  The Herb Box offers a wide range menu with a good selection of grab and go dinners/lunches in the cold case in the bar/pick up side of the restaurant.  They actually have two suites that are side by side that offer sit down and pickup.  

If you are getting To Go or Pickup orders, they do a nice job of using good quality boxes that keep the food protected and warm.  They also will sell their salad dressings (vinagarette = yum) in nice glass take home bottles. 

I highly recommend the Butternut Squash Enchiladas.  They are little more pricey than everything else on the menu and lack a true side, but they are very rich in flavor and have a very pleasant spicy taste that trailers the sweetness the butternut squash offers.  They are also cooked to perfection leaving the cheese nicely melted and crisping up the shell without it becoming soggy.

They offer a nice variety of salads and side options.  Another few notes, the mac n' cheese in the To Go case is a good reheat item to take home for a side or late night snack or powerful enough for a dinner.  The vinegarette  goes great with an orzo pasta and feta cheese.  The take home baked goods are very tasty.

Cozy little cafe style feel at The Herb Box and a simple menu with big flavor give this a 4 star rating!","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

We informed him that we would like separate checks and he curtly informed us that they did not do separate checks. I could understand if they had been very busy but they were pretty empty. I asked to speak to the manager and she told me that it would not be a problem and that it was done all the time. Then he took forever to bring our drinks and to return to get our dinner orde. When the food came out the portions were small and nothing to write home about. I ordered ""prawns"" which consisted of 4 shrimp albeit they were large , but certainly not worth the money. The waiter barely checked on us and our water gasses went un refilled for most of the evening. When it was check time the waiter dis courteously informed us that it would take awhile to get done. I could have understood if it was a very large party, but there were just six of us there. We paid and hurried out of there.
Against my better judgement we went there with another group of friends on another night about a year later thinking maybe it was just that server. The drinks took forever to be delivered and the food was not delivered much better. Some people were almost finished eating before others had even been served. I was one of the forgotten. I called the manager over and she hurried off and assured me that mine was a priority and would be brought out pronto. I had ordered Maine Lobster and it came out very under cooked and needless to say I could not eat it. We were running late to go dancing so we asked for the checks. Oh boy what another fiasco. The waiter brought out some checks while totally forgetting about the others. A very mild mannered friend was so upset I could hear him speaking to the manager all the way across the room and he was not pleased to say the least.

House black tea with grass jelly at 20% sweetness and half ice. The amount of sweetness and caffeine is a perfect pick me up for the mid-afternoon. The grass jelly adds an interesting texture without being too disruptive to the taste of the tea. 

Service: Excellent. I've been here twice and have been treated well each time. 

Drinks: the first time I was here, I ordered the Earl Grey crema with pudding. Pudding is one of my favorite treats for bubble tea. The crema though was overwhelming. The first few sips were decadent- I could feel the cream saltiness rolling over my tongue. But I couldn't finish the drink. It was just too much. Perhaps if I'd gotten a sweeter drink it would have tasted like melted ice cream. But in an effort to not get diabetes, I stuck with the 20%. I would not recommend this. 

Today's drink, however, was what I look for when I go for bubble tea. I'd come back here. 

Ambiance: I'm fond of the back of the cafe. There's a long wooden table that would be great for catching up with a friend or for studying. I imagine the music would be a little too loud for such activities in the front of the building.

Its part coffee shop, part crepe cafe, part antique store. Nothing like this exists in NEO and I am SO happy its here. The name Brewella is born off a fabulous, fictional character inspired by Iris Apfel. Brewella is an older, stylish gal adorned in pearls and red glasses. The entire cafe is impeccably curated with art, teacups, brooches and more for sale. Its a visual feast that immediately makes you feel happy the moment you enter. There is not one square inch that isn't colorful, beautiful and fun. Just FYI, metered street parking only, so bring quarters.

Immediately, I loved that the chairs had cushions, and some even had arm rests! I am OVERJOYED to find a coffee shop that WANTS you to stay and doesn't force you into a reclaimed wood stump that serves as seating. Plenty of outlets are against the walls, and the wi-fi is strong. On these merits alone, I could stay here all day and work.

I tried a tomato basil crepe and a latte. The crepe was made with a wonderful batter. Batter is the hallmark of any good crepe, and my friend even commented the crepes were as good as they are in Paris. The tomato was hearty and the cheese was generous and flavorful. I felt so full after one crepe! The latte was also delicious. It was simple but satisfying. Overall, I adore Brewella's and can't wait to come back soon! Brewella's is a creative, special edition to Cleveland's cafe scene. Stop in for a cup of coffee or maybe leave with a vintage brooch of a honeybee.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Went some time ago and wanted to revisit. Decor is great and service is attentive and friendly. The place is owned by a gentleman from Mexico who worked in Spain before, precisely in the Basque country. While the food is Spanish, it is not 100% Basque and  many regions of Spain are represented . We shared one main and a degustation menu ( 4 pintxos and one maint $38.00, a great deal).

Pintxos were the following: cream of mushroom, duck magret and lentil salad, foie gras and a stuffed fig (Mahon cheese and Serrano ham.)
Mains we had were salt cod (bacalao) with virgin sauce, grilled cherry tomatoes and mashed potatoes, and also duck magret with saffron risotto. Dishes were all very good, full of flavour and well-executed. However, the weakest link here was the stuffed fig. While the sweetness of the fruit can be well paired with saltiness, Mahon cheese and Serrano ham together overpowered the fig. I would have preferred to feel a better balance, a better flavour contrast.
We split a dessert, tarta queso, a chessecake made with Spanish cheeses that was sweet but just enough and very satisfying.
Libation-wise, we each had a fino (Rama, $11) , which is one of the best aperitifs one can ask for, and we had a bottle of  Spanish white, a Rias Baixa Terras Gauda 2011, crisp and refreshing and perfect with all our food selections. I was disappointed by my coffee, which while good, was not a Cafe con leche but a cafe latte. Booh. Do I have to go back to Madrid? I think so!

Overall though, Pintxo is a gem. A small, cozy place that serves great food with the best ingredients. You will have a wonderful meal.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

It's located in the food court in the underground pathway in the Hundson Bay Centre.

They have a great display sandwiches, salads, soup and assorted baked goods as well as hot beverages.

I decided to combo it up and got a sandwich with 2 salads:

Ham & brie w/ basil pesto Panini with Sundried tomato pasta salad & Lemony Chickpea salad

My sister got the Roast beef w/ creole mustard, so of course we split half and half to get the best of both worlds!

Both sandwiches were served on a white baguette and were equally good and fresh tasting. Despite how long they took to toast the sandwiches the insides were not quite as hot as I would have liked and the cheese was not all gooey melty as I would have expected. I would ask them next time to toast it longer for my liking. But taste wise the sandwiches were pretty grrreat! The salads were really refreshing and great in flavour.

We had to get dessert because they had such a great selection of Dufflet individual cakes and pastries. We opted for:

Chocolate Raspberry Mousse Mini -Chocolate mousse with a heart of raspberry mousse, finished with a red glaze and a shard of dark chocolate. 
This was super yummy and beautiful presented. I love the sweet milk chocolate fluffy moussse contrasted by the suttle tangy fruity raspberry glaze with a sweet raspberry mousse filling in the centre.

Nanaimo Bars - A chocolate crumb base, followed by a layer of light custard buttercream, and topped with a smooth and glossy layer of semi sweet chocolate.    
I always get excited when I see these authentic Canadian treats! Perfect traditional nanaimo bar, no flaws.

As well they serve Red Rose Tea so I got one, a large is $2 bucks.

Overall you get a lot of fresh tasting great flavour food for a very reasonable price, I believe it was about 14 bucks with tax for one sandwich with 2 salads, a large tea and a dessert.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

This location is 5 years old at the time of this review yet it looks newer than that. All of the amenities that you could want and everything appears to be clean and well kept. The room was spacious and well appointed with plenty of pillows and toiletries. There was also a microwave, refrigerator, and a coffee pot. If you have service needs you may want to look elsewhere as there doesn't seem to be much in the way of staff but I didn't have any problems.

The full breakfast in the lobby cafe was good @ about $13 and you may want to look for rates that include breakfast to save a couple $'s.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Good food, the cook is from Pampanga, where my family is from as well. They're are also very nice, I don't speak that much Tagalog, but are very welcoming. They have a $5.99 combo for white rice, and two entrees. Portion size was decent, I was able to share my meal with my sister. Usually I like to go early afternoon, because of the tip the other yelped stated how things were cooked fresh from 9am-12pm.

now, when we were reading the specs and reviews of the hotel, we were under the impression that each room is equipped with a mini fridge.  so we were surprised to find no fridge in our room.  went to front desk to inquire, and were told that we had to make advanced arrangement for it since there are only 4 floating around, mostly stationed in the ""suites"".  but we could request for one in the next morning, which we did, and we got one rolled into our room shortly. yes now we can keep our drinks cold and all, but this little monster rattles when you don't set it in the right place. whether it just vibrated against the floor or the door was loose, it just kept buzzing unless you rolled it around a bit or put some heavy thing on top. minor issues.

plus side, they do provide free wi-fi internet. but instead of being automatically detected, you'll have to sign in on their webpage using their given IDs and passwords, which makes intermittent connection cumbersome coz you have to start that page and re-connect every time. but, again, minor issues. at least while i was connected i hardly ever got dropped, which is much more important.

upon check-out, i realized i have only made reservations through expedia.com, not having paid for it in full.  that's fine; i generally don't care who i make the payments to as long as the rate is honored. and i understand there MAY be taxes added on top of the advertised rate, i did not get that when i booked the hotel in toronto and had it prepaid via hotels.com. now i'm ""stuck"" w/the 13% sales tax and some lodging fees???  that's like extra $65 for 4 nights of stay.  and i already paid MORE than what i got in toronto, where the hotel was nicer and cheaper and also came w/free parking.  this place, extra $15+tx a day for a separate garage parking!  fine, considering how precious parking spaces are in here.  

the garage is just around the corner (the hotel has 1-2 15-min parking spots blocked off right outside its door for check-in/out).  the side street leading to/from it can be deemed a little sketchy at night w/its dim lighting and having an alley filled w/toss-aways right next to it.  the parking lot inside was well-lit, clean, and without wanderers. they seem to have a gate that can completely close and shut off the garage from the outside, but i had not seen it down once, not even at 1am on a saturday night. however, they have a couple surveillance cameras there.  overall, it does seem safe (personal and property-wise) while inside. parking spots are spacious too, unlike many reviews i've read about other hotels. 

i know i can't compare apples and oranges. but just by the hotel itself, it's an ""ok"".  not too hot if i'm getting charged some CAD$100+tx a day AND another CAD$15+tx a day for parking, and stayed in a 2.5-star establishment w/minimum amenities.  staff was friendly and patient, though; very laid-back if you asked me.  entrance and elevators are small, but at least they are there. 

plus side, the cafe downstairs (kilo) is RIGHT THERE and you can get food till late w/o even having to walk out of the street.  there are also a few other pubs, restaurants, and sandwich/sushi take-out places right at the corner of ste-catherine w/in a couple blocks by the turn. and the berri-UQAM train station is only a block away.

great for single travelers who are working/visiting in the area; not for those looking for actions at night as the bars and clubs all gather on ste-catherine O past rue peel and on maisonneuve (unless you care to pay extra for cabs).  however, my bf went out w/his friends in the aforementioned happening area, and didn't have anything happen to him walking 20 blocks back to the hotel at 3am.  so while there may be homeless people roaming around, the streets didn't seem so bad at night.  that or maybe he was just lucky....?  lol.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

I happened through town this afternoon and noticed a sign that said ""The Locavore's Choice,"" so I had to stop and investigate. Sure enough, Paoli Local Foods is a charming store in a one-pony town, chock full of delicious, local products! There are cases and freezers stocked with local grass-fed beef, elk, deer, ostrich, chicken, duck, pork, lamb, and buffalo. There's a seafood case with smoked fish and frozen blue gill, halibut, salmon, etc.  I'm sure this list is even missing a number of their offerings. Oh, and did I mention their selection of local cheeses? Check.

Other products are available, such as small production organic canned foods and toiletries, but I won't lie--you can get these elsewhere in Madison for much less. All the same, it's cool that Paoli Local Foods is providing a much-needed outlet to this rural area. Another feature that I noticed, in the back of the store is a bulk section and also a small cafe featuring lunch items such as soup and sandwiches. Next time I'm going to the New Glarus Brewery with out of town guests, I think we'll make a stop here!

Lastly, I just found an article that talks about the store more in-depth: http://www.sustainabletimes.net/node/41","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

We were visiting from the T. The reviews seemed okay - we were soooo hungry, possibly a bit light headed and wanting somewhere close walking distance and reasonable, and the menu looked promising... We popped over (even though the pics looked weirdly like a fancy cafeteria). The upside, the house beer was reasonable at 5.5 (downside, not a tasty craft beer). Shared 3 items: chorizo poutine, lots of curds and gravy and thinly sliced fried chorizo on top. Okay value. Next, the French onion soup, more like weak beef broth with an onion waved over it -not worth it and we didn't finish it.  Don't even bother with the fried chicken and waffle. Even though I was famished, I couldn't ignore that it tasted not unlike an eggo with 2 pinty tenders and Aunt Jemima syrup drizzled over it (if you've had a good chicken and waffle u won't want this). Overall, I felt I had to give 3 stars as they don't gouge you; however, I wouldn't recommend this for anyone visiting Montreal and looking for good food. I didn't mention the service - no, I didn't.

From Bravo Cucina Italiana to Kilgore Trout, it truly is a diverse ""collection"" of restaurants, boutiques, and atrium shops. 

Stop by Barnes & Noble and find some great reading material or meet a friend for coffee in their cafe! The restaurants run the gamut from fine dining at Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar to soups and salads at The Stone Oven Bakery and Cafe. There is even a Trader Joe's grocery store there! 

The shopping center itself is stunning, especially in the summer. The landscaping is lush and colorful, with exotic flowers that are even labeled for your own knowledge! The winter time offers an escape from the cold with the indoor atrium shops, in a traditional ""mini-mall"" setting. 

The parking lot is very large and easy to navigate through, but valet parking is available at some of the restaurants for your convenience. I always feel safe when I am at Eton, and the Woodmere Police Department is always patrolling the shopping center. 

It always feels like I am on vacation when I visit Eton!

The restaurants at the Palazzo are just plain not well thought out.  

Take for example the three Chinese restaurants there:  ""Woo"", ""Zine"", and ""Mainland"".   All 3 are separated by a very different philosophical difference.  ""Mainland"" is practically fast food.  ""Zine"" is more like a the quick dish joint with a really large menu whereas ""Woo"" (which has it's originations from the famed Mayflower restaurant locally in Las Vegas) has a small menu with very carefully selected & prepared tasty dishes that will always please the palate. 

THE WINNER:  ""WOO""
Hands down:  ""Woo"" has become a favorite restaurant of my wife and I in Las Vegas.  The shrimp dumplings and the Kalbi Ribs on rice were two of my favorite dishes while in Las Vegas.  It sort of reminded me of Kevin Wu's old Dim Sum restaurant at the Venetian called ""Royal Star"" which has since closed much to our dismay and disappointment.  And if you speak Chinese and you ask nicely, you might be able to order ""off the menu"" and ask for... well, basically anything.  The chefs are skilled in creating virtually anything you want but I'd try what's on the menu first.  This is some of the best Chinese food I've eaten in Las Vegas without a doubt. 

Why?  Well... here we go:

1)  FLAVORS, FLAVORS, FLAVORS:
Man, do these folks know flavors.  I may go into the poor house buying their shrimp dumplings or their Kalbi ribs but damn is this place tasty.  The culinary concoctions that they've put together are just superb.
...And folks:  The menu is small for a reason.  It's because most of the dishes are so caringly prepared, they take longer than a normal Chinese restaurant.  I wish some of the other reviewer's would understand that.  If you're running a restaurant, you don't want to have people spending forever trying to make up their mind if you're putting together dishes that frankly take time and care to put together.   This isn't an operation that pulls crap out of a the refrigerator, dumps it into a stir fry pan for 3 minutes and serves it:  Everything is made on the spot.
...So if you're looking for bulk dishes or cheaper prices, just go down to ""Zine"" at the casino level for God's sakes.

2) SERVICE
The waiters there aren't just employees, they're not just customers... they're seriously invested long term into the restaurant.  Just ASK them.  I've had numerous discussions with the friendly waitstaff about why they stay at the restaurant, what the future is of Woo, and why they love it so much, and the answer is pretty consistent:  They believe in the family and their tastes.  The Wu family knows how to make a good dish.
...It should be noted that according to ""The Strip"" podcast Sheldon Adelson himself is a frequent guest just as he was at the Mayflower.  In an interview with the family's daughter,  Adelson originally asked Peter Wu and his family to pull up roots from the old famed Mayflower restaurant and come set up shop at Palazzo and with good reason:  If you want a good flavorful meal to invite a delegation of Chinese businessmen to, this is the place to do it at.  

3) SERENITY
Yes, it's pretty quiet here.  And frankly, I kind of like it.  Unlike the tasteless and raunchy ambiance of Sushi Samba or the cafeteria like atmosphere of Mainland, ""Woo"" is a quiet, off to the side restaurant that focuses more on the food and less on the dynamic.
...Admittedly, this hasn't exactly been their choice.  They don't have the draw of ""Emeril Lagasse"" like Table 10 does or ""Wolfgang Puck"" like CUT does, but those that know, know that Woo's got them all beat for sheer tastiness per dish.

CONCLUSION:
I consider this to be one of my personal secrets that I go to at least for lunch every trip.  I recommend this restaurant to everyone I know as being the only cuisine really worth taking the side trip to try at Palazzo.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Inside is spacious and open. There is a refrigerated case stocked with bottled drinks, but there is also a fountain machine for soft drinks.  I also liked that they offered different Bragg's condiments (Hello Nutritional Yeast Seasoning!) as well as Sriracha sauce and other options. In true cafe style, there are a handful of tables inside and a few tables outside as well.  My personal favorite here (as far as decor) are the canvassed pictures of Santorini along the wall. It makes me long for my bucket list trip to Greece. 

On to the food... This was my first time at Pita Cafe (there is another location further north on Scottsdale Rd), and the worker (owner?) was very nice, helpful, and patient. He answered all of my vegan-y questions. Luckily, this place is very veg*n-friendly. (There are plenty of meat options for you carnivores, but as a vegan, I will focus on their veg*n options.) 

For starters/ appetizers, there are several different flavors of hummus, Veggies Dolmas, Spanakopita (vegetarian, but not vegan due to the feta cheese), veggies and dip, Veggie platter, Baba Ghanoush, etc.  If you enjoy pitas, they have a Veggie Pita (omit the taziki sauce to make it vegan), Grilled Veggie Pita, Hummus &  Tabouli Pita, and of course Falafel Pita.  There are also quite a few (7!!) veg*n salads (if you're vegan just remember to omit any cheeses and the taziki sauce; it contains dairy).
For bigger appetites they have platters. Veg*ns can choose from a Falafel platter or Dolma platter. Both come with your choice of 2 sides. 

I ended up getting the Falafel platter and the Dipitizer. (Wait for it!) 

FALAFEL PLATTER:
My Falafel platter came with 6 perfectly seasoned and cooked falafel balls, what looked like a red and white onion mix, a whole piece of falafel bread, and it normally comes with taziki sauce but he allowed me to substitute for a small cup of hummus (which was perfect). For my 2 sides, I got rice and a greek salad without the cheese.  Their rice is NOT made with animal broth or animal by-products, so it's completely vegan-friendly.  It was very good and the portion was very generous.  Same with the salad. No okie-doke, Baby Stewie portions here. It was a full container (I had a carry-out order) of luscious greenery.


DIPITIZER:
This is for my double-dippers! Raise your pitas in the air! Then dip 'em like you just don't care! Oh yeah! 

You get to try different hummus flavors plus a third dipping dish, which the menu lists as taziki, but again, the worker (owner??) was SO nice and accommodating that he allowed me to sub for Baba Ghanoush (which IS vegan).  
1-JALAPEÑO HUMMUS: Delicious AND it had some spicy kick to it (unlike some other places). Perfect!
2 - ROASTED RED PEPPER HUMMUS: yummy!
3 - HUMMUS: the original hummus flavor, but there is nothing ordinary about it. It's very fresh and each ingredient is distinctly present. Easily the BEST hummus  that I have had in the Phoenix area. 
4 - BABA GHANOUSH: it's a pureed eggplant dish, so it's good for dipping. The flavor was amazing! The eggplant tasted as if it was fresh off the grill and into the mixer. Some of the best Baba Ghanoush I've ever had. (Even if you typically don't like eggplant - like myself - I suggest trying it.)

They don't offer Tahini sauce as a side option, nor do they have french fries.  The tahini apparently isn't popular, so that's an understandable business decision. But the other location offers french fries (goes fabulously with a pita sandwich), but they do not... I had my mouth all ready for some fries. But regardless, I still love this place. Excellent food, excellent customer service.

FYI - they also have gluten free pita options (for an additional charge).

The owner is working on labeling items as veg*n and ""gluten-free options available.""

DD got the Chicken Pita and she loved it. In her words, ""I should've gotten 2!"" Not because it was small, but because it was so good.  
(You can get the Chicken Pita or Gyros for only $5; available all day.)

Looking for them? They are on North Scottsdale Rd, north of FLW/Bell (the tall blue sphere), on the right side of the street (if traveling northbound). They share the parking lot with Sushi Brokers, AT&T, Nothing Bundt Cakes, etc. If you pass the Fairmont, you've gone too far.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

I've gotten a variety of sandwiches and I've liked all of them. Nothing out of this world, but tasty enough. I really liked the cafe salad, it had a good balance of flavor that came together well. The price is reasonable for what you get, the potions are a little on the small side. I like the sandwiches with chicken because it's real chicken and they give you a decent amount, but I got one with ham and it only had two slices. Too measly for the price. 

My biggest complaint (and really only complaint) with this place is the wait time. I'm surprised no one else has commented on it. I've come in a little after lunch time, around 1, with a max of two people ahead of me, and I've had to wait 20 minutes for a simple sandwich. I understand phone orders come in and what not, but I'm sorry, that's unacceptable for one sandwich. The last time I was there, three people who came in after me got their food before mine, one of my biggest pet peeves. The person in front of me got their food promptly and was done and out the door before I got mine! No apologies or even acknowledgment that it was a long wait. The first time I thought it was a fluke, but I've been there a good 8 times and it's been like that every time. 

I'll keep coming back here mainly because it's walking distance from work and there's nothing else around. It's sad though, even with my hour lunch break, I can't even walk because it takes too long to get my food!","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

You can't go two days without someone ordering from them! If the staff is reading this review, please know that your deliveries to our office every other day are truly appreciated!

If you're looking for reasonably portioned sandwiches - and a delicious variety of sandwiches as well - this is your place. I recently ordered the Roma sandwich and have to say I really, really enjoyed it; I can't wait to order again and try some of the other options on this menu, such as their Italian sandwiches. You get a side with your sandwich and can do some half sandwich and soup/salad combos, so basically, this is a local Panera. Although much fresher and not nearly as greased up - always a plus!

If you want a little more portion-wise, then yes, hit up a Panera or go to Eat Unique in Oakland; for our office, though, this little cafe is a lifesaver. It's delicious while being kind to our wallets AND our waistlines. For that, we thank them!","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Heck - you may drive by without even realizing it's there, or - worse - stopping at the larger cafeteria on the corner of the mall or the family-style restaurant across the street.  Either would be a huge mistake.  Instead, head to the corner and find a nice surprise.

While the decor won't win any awards, and the buffet isn't large, what you will find is a well-stocked selection of tasty entrees on the steam table, surprising desserts (including hand-dipped butter pecan ice cream and pecan pie) and staff that is generally eager to please.  The only downfall is the aforementioned location which can be tough to find, the smallness of the place and that they don't generally pay much attention once you are there - so if you drink a lot (as I do), you may find your glass empty more than once.  Still, the food is better than most any buffet - and a number of non-buffets - in Charlotte.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

My boyfriend ordered the prosciutto sandwich and I had the tuna salad sandwich. Both came with a simple side salad that was so delicious!!!

Both of our sandwiches were fantastic and left us very full and content. If you don't like dining outside due to having people stare at what you're having or a few bees flying by, they do have an inside cafe as well with a little boutique attached. The boutique has many different unique items that are great for a gift. We came back here 3 times just to look at stuff over and over again. We ending up buying things on our third trip.

One afternoon while exploring the Old Port part of town we decided to grab some lunch here. As we were sitting outside under the umbrellas on the front patio area the skies opened up and the rain came down. We made a quick retreat with our food and drink to the inside restaurant.

Either way it worked out great. The inside cafe has a terrific cozy decor which was very inviting. Kind of a rustic Parisian feel. Piano in the center. Clean bathroom too.

On the other side is a small boutique shop with all kinds of home goods and miscellaneous items. Nice spot to pick up a gift.

Again, the service was friendly and they leave you be to have time to relax and enjoy your meal. Some say the service is slow, but for a couple like us on vacation and not in a rush it was just right.

Oh, and the food is pretty decent here. Tasty bruschetta with fig compote, a delish pizza with  a smoky cheese flavor, and a tuna with avocado sandwich with a side of quinoa that was solid. Really good choices for a lunch that hit the spot before heading out for more adventure.

Oh, and we had to try out that Montreal 1642 Cola. It's a strange taste but kind of addicting.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

The location, atmosphere and shop next door make the place worth while. The piano player was simply wonderful, everyone enjoyed the music and he played off the guests which was awesome. You can see the water from the windows and the decor is exactly what you might want from a small bistro.

The staff is extremely friendly, they made a table from us (as in took a table from the back to let us sit down) and were friendly and attentive.

We had to ask her three times for the wi-fi and even then, she was immediately distrusting of our intentions as she warned us not to download anything on her personal wi-fi.

Unavoidably, I flipped through the comics and merch they had, and while it is not floor-to-ceiling Silver Snail level of inventory, there are plenty of material for all ages (much it seems for younger folks), the usual superheroes stuff as well as many graphic novel series and lesser known works being featured.

Man, I wish I did not discover this by driving around, but I also wish this secret weapon of a gem wasn't such a long walk from home. Maybe I'll gain some teleportation skills or something.

During our recent trip to AZ, my boyfriend and I decided to grab some food at this vegan cafe and tea room. We heard many reviews about Scottsdale being the city for Foodies and decided to trek out there. We were impressed that there in Scottsdale lies vegetarian-friendly eateries and of course, our new favorite vegan restaurant. The interior is eclectic with a nurturing vibe. The service was impeccable and when you leave the restaurant you feel rejuvenated. 
The food itself was worth every penny and the selection of specialty teas was endless. We snacked on the nachos while drinking our Raspberry Rooibos and Moroccan mint teas. If you plan to share the nachos with a friend, stick to small portion plate because it's more than plenty. Afterward, we devoured our entrees. I ordered the mandala marsala while my boyfriend opted for the curry vermicelli rice noodle bowl. Both dishes were mmmm, mmm good! Portions were generous and if my stomach could expand just another 2 inches, I would have finished the entire plate. Unfortunately we did not have time for dessert. By the end of the night, despite stuffing ourselves we left the restaurant feeling light and healthy. It's good to be vegetarian.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

We ate outside on very uncomfortable metal chairs. The view was nice of the top of camelback, but that was the only bright spot for me that day.  I ordered the West veggie burger but they were out of the soy bacon. And I said that's fine, i don't need that, and then they said that they were out of another ingredient and suggested I order something else. That was fine. I settled on the ziti al forno. Then another waitress came out and told me that the ziti would take another 30 minutes to cook. And  I asked my business associate if that was ok. It was and so I said, no problem. Then like two minutes later my food was on my table. Hmmm...And this was about four ounces of ziti smothered in this  very cheezy (ricotta like) red sauce. The flavor was bland and the pasta was overcooked. It was almost a mushy consistency. The highlight of the dish was two small wedges of garlic bread and a sprinkling of chopped nuts on top. That gave it some much needed texture. All this for $14....YIKES! Since it was a tea room, I did order a tea and was surprised at the presentation. It was a small cafeteria-style glass. I think I would suggest to them to work on their presentation a little more. That was $3 but it could have gone up to $6 if I added two more tea leaf combos to it. My friend did order the soup of the day which sounded pretty good. 

I would probably go back there again to try some of the other food. This review is only based on one visit. I think it might be worth a second look. I'm hoping my next visit is a better one.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Bakery items are nearly always delicious and just what I expected. But the cafe portion of this establishment leaves much to be desired.

A few weeks ago, I ordered a bowl of soup and it was really good. I went back last week, and for the same price, the portion size is much smaller, was more watery, and they didn't have part of my order in stock (this cheddar biscuit that comes with the soup, and really makes the whole dish). When I noticed it was missing and asked, the employees didn't care. 

A few times I've been here and there are long lines despite the fact that the restaurant is nearly empty. On other occasions every table top seems covered with crumbs, or there are dirty rags sitting on tables with no one attending to them.

I also loathe the fact that you can't get a glass of water (they now keep the water cups behind the counter and you have to ask for them).  I will find it hard to return here.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

I was really craving a good smoothie and found them on Google. It was late in the evening (past 8pm) and the Jamba Juice by my house was already closed. So decided to give this place a shot. I walked in and there was only one employee. I told her I was a first-timer and asked what were the popular items. She seemed really pleasant and was super helpful. I also asked what else was included in the smoothie and how they are sweetened. She was very knowledgable about their smoothies; I always appreciate when employees know exactly what they offer at their restaurant/cafe. So I ended up trying the ""Island Greens"". It was amazing and I was instantly hooked! I've been back 3-4 times since then. 

My most recent trip was earlier today for lunch. I typically just get a smoothie but since I hadn't eaten lunch yet, I decided to try their food. This time there were two guys working. I asked they guy at the register about their flatbreads and he was able to describe them with detail and even suggested his favorites. So I ordered the Tzatziki Steak Flatbread. It was pretty good - it was basically a circle pita bread, toasted, and folded in half, stuffed with steak, Tzatziki sauce, tomatoes, lettuce, and onions. I think there was some cheese in there too, but I ate it so fast I didn't even notice. I would recommend it. 

Smoothies: 5-Stars! The Island Greens was the first thing I tried and haven't looked back. It's what I get every time.

Food: I have only tried the Tzatziki Steak Flatbread, and it was pretty good. Not too sure how fresh the steak was but I presume it is a better choice than your McDonald's and Burger King's of the world.

Customer Service: From the previous reviews, it would seem like this place has some issues with management, training their employees, and customer service, but I haven't had a problem with them. I suppose their staff could be a little more ""jolly"" but it's not like they were rude by any means.

Overall: Super happy with their smoothie. Customer service met my standards. Because this place is a SMOOTHIE spot, I give them 5-Stars.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

We saw this, on a rainy afternoon, and took a chance. A great little neighborhood cafe! we were in luck. They had homemade Italian wedding soup, and several ethnic type specialties -- weinerschnitzel, stuffed pork chops, etc.

Prices are extremely reasonable here. You can eat a nice lunch for $6.99 or breakfast (weekdays) for $2.99! can't hardly go wrong. But of course, the acid test is ""is the food good""? Yes, it was! We enjoyed everything we ordered.

Nothing like hot soup on a cold rainy day; this hit the spot! a cup is only $1.99, a huge bargain. It tasted homemade, with lots of farro or some oval grain in it and lots of tiny chicken meatballs. My husband had a very good burger with crisp fries, a good value at $5.49 for a cheeseburger on a delicious toasted bun. Even with the soup and fries, he didn't crack $10.

I had the stuffed pork chop special; two fork tender stuffed porkchops in rich gravy, with mashed potatoes and green beans. (I also had the soup.) It was $8.99 and the two meaty pork chops would have probably fed two smaller appetites (or one to take home). They were the BEST I've had in ages -- only my grandma's could have compared! The gravy was very good, the mashed potatoes OK (probably instant, but OK) and the green beans, canned. If I had to do again, I'd have substituted the crisp french fries -- and had them drown 'em in that gravy. YUM.

We did not have time for desert, but passed the desert case, with some yummy looking pudding, pies and other sweets. It was a plain, but clean eatery with good service and food was piping hot. Beats any fast food around, and for not much more $$$.

There was a very tasty looking breakfast buffet, for $8.99 -- all you can eat, with the typical brunch items.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. We will go out of our way to eat here again!","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

You order, they cook, you move down the line and you pick up your food, you find a place to sit, you eat, you leave.  This is a cafeteria style order, pay, pickup and self seat type of place.

While this place may seem like a constant machine of serving the public there is a bit of a charm that comes with a place that been around so long and has such a loyal customer base and the fact that this place doesn't have to be trendy, bend to any trend because they are masters of doing what they do.

With the ever increasing prices of food and general rise of costs in everything this place is your proverbial oasis and harbor in the storm.  The problem with being as popular as this place can be what you will experience is fighting for parking, fighting for a place to sit but when all that falls into place what you will have is a LOT of food for a really reasonable price.  

Meals here are enough to feed 2 normal hungry adults.  I'm a big guy and if I was really hungry MAYBE I could finish a souvlaki meal but I highly doubt it.  The servings here are borderline absurd.  This place is probably the Greek/Canadian equivalent of ""Claim Jumper"" in the US that being serving sizes are pretty much on the family size side.

My brother paid for both meals and we ended up sharing a bit of each plate.  To put it in eating terms we are self proclaimed ""heavy hitters"" when it comes to being able to eat a lot.  I mean we pride ourselves in being the type of customers that all you can eat places treat as ""the exception"" and we often try to gauge what we eat at those types of establishments to be able to say, yeah, we made a ""profit"".  
 
Besides the almost obscene amount of food you receive from Zet's the food itself is better than average.  The burgers are OK.  The fries taste good but I wish the batch we had received had less of the ""crunchy bit, small bits, tiny pieces"".  I prefer long fries as opposed to tiny pieces.  My brother had ordered the Zet's burger which is basically a double bacon cheese burger and it's pretty big.  For 9 dollars before tax that's not much at all considering how much beef is and how much it costs to even go to McDonald's.  The large fries that he ordered was 5 bucks.  It's a pretty large plate of fries for 5 bucks.  Basically for 13 plus tax his 2 plates barely fit on the tray he carried it on.  

I had ordered the gyro plate which I assumed was going to be a rice, salad, potatoes and gyro meat on a single plate.  I was wrong.  It was one PLATTER of rice, Greek salad  (maybe 6 or more olives, feta, onions, lettuce, tomatoes), what equates to a whole potato on one plate and then an entire OTHER plate for a gyro in a pita complete with tzatziki, tomatoes, etc.  It was a HUGE meal for 14 bucks plus tax.  The gyro was great tasting and their tzatziki went so well with it as I think it sort of needed the sauce as it was a lot of meat in that wrap that needed to be lubricated.

They have ""help yourself"" pitchers of water with red plastic glasses at the front counter as well as take out containers because you know, they expect you won't eat it all at the restaurant.  The water is nice because that's all I wanted, not necessarily bottled and I didn't want pop.

They only take cash but for your convenience they have 2 ATMs at the right side of the counter.  There is no place to bus your own platters and it seems they have a dedicated person to do that.  The fight for tables is a real one.  I had my red water I had put down at a table right by the pick up counter and by the time I had picked up some salt, pepper, and ketchup, extra napkins and returned some dude was putting his stuff down at the table.  I politely mentioned I had my drink there already and he said he thought it was from before and politely left the table.  

The bottom line is this place is hands down probably the best bang for the buck place I know of because the portion sizes for the cost could have you wondering how this place makes money... well they also serve steak but their souvlaki platters are dare I say, ""epic"".

Oh and for being able to eat here how does 24 hours sound?  Just think how busy a place like this would be after the bars close... 

You can see the Vista cargo terminal at Pearson from here as that's right across the street.

Honestly I am seriously slacking because I've been going to this place for years now and I swear I haven't been holding out purposely to keep this little gem to myself.

Let me first say that this place is truly the essence of what a road side diner is and all it encompasses so do not expect a trendy, pristine or refined place. Its spacious, offering plenty of seating in a sort of cafeteria/diner style with I will admit little to no interior design concept however they have recently updated their signage and a touch of interior redesigning going on so one must give them some credit on the effort.  

Open 24hrs for as long as I can remember this place has always been my go to place for Souvlaki; Huge portions with fresh, juicy chicken chunks and salad which is rare for an all night diner. I recently finally tried their burgers which are quite large and affordable too, standard condiment options but still a very tasty burger. I am not the biggest fan of their Caesar salad as I feel its a bit bland and on the watery side but I generally go for onion rings here anyway  They have all the usual artery clogging yumminess one would expect and they make a pretty mean breakfast too.
Food quality is always consistent and fresh which I didn't think would be the case upon first encountering the place years ago... But do not judge a book by its cover this place is a perfect example of that.

I find the service has always been good and very fast as well, especially considering the lineups cause this place can get busy late on the weekends. Regardless the service is always pleasant and I find them extremely appreciative of tips 

I am a night owl... Heck Yelp has even given me a badge for it but among all my late night spots this one always has my back when Im in need of a delicious and fast bite","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

The parking lot is treacherous,the staff gruff and the interior even gruffer. However do not let the parking lot and cafeteria like interior stop you. The souvlaki is flavourful and moist, the tazitki full of garlic and flavour. But don't think this is a one stop shop, they have steaks, fish, veal etc.

We have never been able to connect with him there so decided to go ourselves since we were close by at a convenient time. The disappointment for me was finding a cafeteria; I guess I really do appreciate waiter or waitress service!

Well it seems we got there at just the right time, as there were a few people ahead of us, but the lineup behind us just mushroomed! There were 7 or 8 people prepping the food, and nobody answers the phone (it rang about 10 times before I gave up.) but when we got there I barely had time to decide what I wanted when it was time to order. We took specials, but were a bit surprised at how expensive it came to (about $35.00). Getting through the line to where they were putting the meals together, we found out why: the somewhat grumpy woman at the cash got our order completely wrong! So the guy serving us unceremoniously dumped $12 back on our tray. I won't give these guys points for their customer service! 

And yes, by the way, they really are open 24 hours a day, 7 days per week! Crazy. And the clientele we saw were mostly men, and it seemed to be a bit of a league of nations. No problem with that - it just made it more interesting. It was, on the other hand, a bit nerve wracking to have a security guard at the door! They must occasionally have problems. But the customers didn't mind - they were ogling her!

However, the portions are very large, and the good was tasty, the meet quite tender. We had leftovers. 

On the other hand, I am in no hurry to go back! It's not my idea of fine dining. Besides, I prefer sit down service. For me, this visit felt too rushed. No wonder: we were in an out in 20-25 minutes!","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

I'm no exception to this! This is the only place you can get a steak at 2am, cooked to order right in front of you! Whether or not you'd want one, I'm not sure however, I can safely say Zet's has made it possible for many flights to leave on time at 6am! Just a short hop across the street from the airport, Zet's offers up diner-style food in a warm and comfortable cafeteria style setting. They are famous for their souvlaki and steaks on a bun as well as their burgers. I myself am partial to the gyro which comes on a very tasty and soft pita with homemade THICK tzaziki sauce. If you're looking for a quick bite at any hour of the day, Zet's is the place to find it. Prices are reasonable, although not cheap by any standards. A souvlaki dinner (with rice, potatoes, and salad) will run you about $12-14. The burgers are around $6-8. Sandwiches (gyro, souvlaki, steak) will run you around $8-12. However, the All-Day-Breakfast is the best value at around $6-9 for a full serving of eggs, bacon/sausage, potatoes, and coffee. Alcohol is also available!

Tip: With the elimination of airline meals on pretty much every flight under 5 hours, why not grab a tasty breakfast before your 6am flight!

I found this place through Chowhound, my second foodie news home. I was a little concerned at first about the place since it sounded more like a cafeteria instead of a diner but I gave it a shot anyways since it was so close to Pearson. 

It's supposedly a popular spot with airport personnel but while I was there I saw all kinds of people including truckers and businessmen who might have worked in the area. My friend and I had breakfast, which I believe is served all day, that included 2 eggs, home fries, buttered toast, your choice of bacon/ham/sausage, and coffee for the great low price of $5.99. I thought it was a steal with the amount of food we got. Pretty standard fare for a greasy spoon diner.

I went to McDonald's afterwards.

But it's now my go-to for Thai food in the area (not much competition, but still...).

The prices are about the same as Salad King and the portions are smaller - but the everything we've had actually TASTES LIKE THAI FOOD.

It replaced a crappy Chinese restaurant which probably replaced a crappy diner (which had a long bar for some reason), so the decor sucks.  And it's definitely not a trendy spot like Salad King -- but the food is good and you don't have to rub elbows with strangers in the cafeteria-esque dining room at Salad King.

It's located very close to Salad King which is a tough competitor. Salad King is owned by Chinese. Thai On Yonge is owned by Thai.

Here's our go to items:

Banana nut bread 
Pumpkin bread 
Lobster eggs Benedict 
Crispy bacon
Crispy hashbrowns 

Nothing fancy just good ol diner style cooking. Exactly how I expect great diner food to taste. I can't rave enough about how much I love their lobster Benedict here. The perfectly ripe avocado is a luscious touch, the English muffin is always toasted perfectly so it has a nice light crunch even after it's been smothered in their crazy tasty house hollandaise sauce and the perfectly poached egg. They really got this recipe down. It is superb! The only spot in Vegas that rivals this bene is mimosas cafe for their bene. But both are winning in my book for breakfast. 

The portions here are generous so I dont feel too bad about sharing. I can only finish half of the eggs Benedict and I always try to push my limit since its just soooo good.

Another HK style restaurant to add to my list.  Ming's is your typical HK style restaurant, nothing more, nothing less.

Pros:
Ample seating for a small place
Prices are good

Cons:
Portions on some items could be better

We came in for breakfast on a Saturday morning.  It was about 1000 and the place was already full.  For a small place, there's about 12 booths and a bunch of tables in the middle.  Turnover is real quick and we were seated in less than 5 minutes.  For all those seats in a small place, it doesn't have that cramped feeling you get at other small HK style cafes.  

We ordered a couple of breakfast specials.  I had a beef brisket noodle soup and a egg and ham sandwich to share with my little one.  My GF had the breakfast special which came with eggs, sausage (hot dogs), ham and toast.  Each special comes with a hot drink and you pay a little more for a cold one.  The food comes out very quick.  My noodle was very good.  It could of used a little more brisket but they gave you oodles of noodles.  The rice noodle they used was to my liking as well.  It stayed consistently al dente throughout the meal.  The sandwich was more of a miss.  The bread was rather thick, but there wasn't much inside.  It was literally one egg and a slice of ham.  For $3.99 they could of at last given me two eggs. My GF's breakfast special was not bad.  Her toast was different from the bread I got for my sandwich if anything to note.

Service here is on par with other places.  There's no glaring flaws of any sort to report.  We didn't need the third drink for our specials because our little one didn't need one so they gladly gave us a discount on one of the specials to make up for it.

Most of what I'm going to say is not new or shocking. I was disappointed with my visit to The Rec Room - though not for the reasons you expect.

Maybe I'm just spoiled, because there's been a glammed-up arcade (the Sega Playdium) that's existed in Mississauga for the better part of two decades. That business knows what it is, who its target audience is and how to effectively capitalize on either of them effectively.

The Rec Room is bizarrely offputting. It's a small arcade, high(er)-end restaurant, glorified cafeteria and some kind of upscale event space all in one. Guys in suits patrol as security while kids scream for their mothers, the venue is consumed with overbearing arcade sounds and you can barely hear yourself think, let alone enjoy this space as it was (supposedly) meant for. It's trying to be an upscale venue, but it can't escape the trappings - long lines (even for some games), kids running amok and overpriced tickets (not to mention an absurdly-overpriced VR attraction with Ghostbusters - was there anyone chomping at the bit to play that after the 2016 film bombed?).

I thought this place was some kind of club and dressed a little more formal to match, only to learn that it's anything but that. I came here with five friends and we considered ourselves fortunate to grab a table in Three10 in a matter of moments. After twenty minutes of a waitress not showing up, I took a look around and realized that you HAD to make a reservation just to get a table, and there was a line stretching out the door.  If I'm understanding this correctly, they have no protocol in place to handle people who wish to play games and eat at the restaurant afterwards without a song-and-dance just to get a table.

It wasn't helped by the fact that there is a desk right near the entrance to the restaurant that appears to be where you show up to get seated, but they just direct you elsewhere. Fed up, we ended up leaving that part.

Even then, there's nothing on the menu (from what I saw beforehand) that's much different than what's already offered at other Cineplex locations. The bizarre part is that the higher-end restaurant and the ""cafeteria"" section are right next to each other. You can purchase food from the cafeteria (with a similar selection of menu items) in moments, yet you have to sit for a long time just to get served in the classier section? Did no one realize how confusing that is for people?

The games are a mixed bag. There are some quality titles like Aliens: Extermination (a game that does not try to conform to the canon of the film series at all) and Star Wars: Battle Pod, where you can get a guaranteed 5 minutes of simulator action out per card swipe. Yet, the games are either confusingly set-up (the four player table hockey booth has a counter that starts running down for 3 minutes as soon as the first player swiped in, and the cards don't register correctly half the time) or they're easily damaged.

One game we tried had the machine take two credit amounts (6 each) from my friend, who had to go up and ask for a credit refund, while another machine got broken just from a ball hitting the edge of a tile and jarring it out of alignment.

There's a prize area, a la Chuck E Cheese and Dave & Busters, where you can refund your points for prizes, but don't hold out much hope of getting one of the uber-elite items like a designer wallet or expensive souvenir - they run upwards of 25,000.

I'm still not sure why we came here. My best friend (who suggested the place from the get-go) looked increasingly confused and embarrassed that he brought us there, and we all agreed to skip out after an hour to go to a nearby Keg. After all, if you're going to charge upwards of $20 for some menu items, you should have the atmosphere to match. This wasn't it.

I don't see myself coming back here again.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

We were walking by casually, and we saw the enormous sign on the glass ""DONUT MACARONS"", so we decided to stop in and give it a shot. The superliminal advertising was very effective, and I have to give them props for it. Yet, everyone is trying to combine random baked goods to create an evolved, super pastry, but to be honest, Delysees fell a little short.

The inside is really nice, and there are a lot of cool decorations. It's a nice place to set up camp, and do some work, since the tables are nice, and it doesn't seem like it's ever really crowded. The general presentation of the space is pretty nice, and it feels like you're in a nice, upscale cafe. The staff was really patient, and really helpful with their recommendations, so it was nice to know what was popular and what wasn't.

Onto the actual desserts. At $2.55 each, the donut macaron is really expensive, especially for something that's not filling at all. I've had my fair share of macarons, and it didn't seem like the donut macaron was any different, save the icing and the hole in the middle. It's interesting that they're selling them for more than regular macarons, when they technically give you less ""stuff."" I completely understand that macarons in general are always going to be expensive, but I'd rather go for the normal macaron than their fairly weak attempt at combining them with doughnuts. With that said, their normal macarons looked great, and were quite expertly presented.

Perhaps we needed to try their other baked goods, but we weren't particularly hungry, and there wasn't anything else that really caught our eye. In general, I understand what they're trying to do with the donut macaron, but it's just not for me, I guess.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

I'm not a huge fan of macarons. They're just cute, little, sugary items that come in various flavours. This visit at Delysees I wanted to try their 'Golden' eclair ($4), which my friend suggested was tasty and wasn't too sweet. This sounded appealing to me because I actually enjoy desserts that are not overly sweet such as cheesecake or some sort of rhubarb pie, both my favourite type of desserts. Most of my girlfriends are sweet heads and love their sugar, unlike myself. I wanted to somehow prepare myself, because not really sweet to her can still be really sweet to me. So I ordered a black decaffinated coffee for the 'just in case' it was too sweet moment. It actually turned out to be not so bad. It was sweet but not overwhelmingly sweet. It was just right for me I guess. For their eclairs they have so many flavours it was hard to just choose one. Some flavours caught my attention like fig and coconut which I will try on my next visit there. However, I won't go out of my way like I would for some other dessert cafes.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Although, it has a rather stark modern interior it does have a comfortable vibe. 

It may, all, in fact, be due to the baked goods in their showcase. Incredible and inviting with not only warm pastry but small, snack sized and I must say, rather adorable sandwiches. I tried the chicken sandwich and a mini apple turnover. Just enough to tide me over until dinner.

There's a multitude to choose from. It has its work cut out for it but it has managed to stick around despite places like Portland variety, Nadege and other bakery and cafes in the area. 

It's nestled a little bit away from all of them to make this a nice alternative from the rest. Worthwhile in every respect.

I'd like to call what they offer little French bites. Mind you, not all of it is little, there are regular sizes for everything. Lol

The big surprise came for me on my return trip. I again purchased sandwiches, and again they were delicious, but the reason Delysees gets three stars is because of the cafe mocha I purchased. It was not only the worst mocha I've ever tried, but likely the worst hot beverage I've ever had. It tasted like hot water with a weird salty flavour. I was extremely disappointed with my mocha.

Original Review:

I had a groupon that shaved about 50% off and without it, I never would have thought about coming here. I still found it incredibly expensive for what we got. 

The voucher was for 2 sandwiches, 2 drinks, and a mini dessert. Sounds good...except that if you're here for the food, you'll be disappointed by the value. The sandwich was about the size of my index + middle finger (and I'm not obese). You can eat the sandwich in about 2 bites. Drinks are...drinks. We had coffee. The mini dessert was indeed very mini. So basically I paid for 3 bites of food x 2 + 2 drinks. 

Portion wise, it's a total failure. Quality wise it wasn't horrible but it's definitely not worth my money. The sandwiches were PREMADE and we arrived in the evening. Who knows how long it has been sitting there. Also, it's a sandwich. I can go to the grocery store, buy the same ingredients and make it myself. There was absolutely nothing special about that sandwich, except for the ridiculous price they want to charge for it. The mini-dessert thing was unremarkable as I can't even recall what it was like.

I would give this place 1 star if it was a regular restaurant or cafe. Its saving grace is the decor. It's a pretty place. You come here for the atmosphere, not for the food.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Their glass counter showcases neat rows of sandwiches: tuna, bocconcini and tomato, ham, salmon, chèvre, and procuitto. There were some options for a salad (I had the corn and red pepper - don't recall the other two) and it all makes for a nice for a light lunch - or a lunch with plenty of options. 

Their sandwiches are dainty little things that would please those looking for something less heavy to nibble on. Or if you're like me, someone who can't decide and likes to have options. So instead of one large sandwich, you'll get two (or three!) little ones. I tried their smoked salmon and their bocconcini sandwiches and found them as-expected. These are typical French sandwiches that are made from few ingredients, but usually of decent quality. The bread itself, I wish was a little chewier inside - a little more bounce to things. 

They also have extra snack-sized sandwiches on sweet bread: gruyere, ham, blue cheese, mortadella, and tuna. I'm told that these are currently the rage in Paris. Not having been recently (or often, sigh), I can't confirm this, but I did enjoy the sweet+savoury bite. I'd see this as a great option for those who aren't interested in sweets for an afternoon bite.

Baked goods are fair - I tried the mini versions of the raisin roll, pain au chocolat, croissant, and the apple turnover. My favourite of the four was the apple turnover - a nice little not-too-sweet treat. Their croissant does not supplant my current pick of the city. I wonder if the larger versions would yield better results.

If I overheard correctly, their coffee is a custom fine grind from Colorado(?). Cappuccinos may be ordered wet or dry, which is a nice option I'm not always given.

My overall thought is that I'd return for lunch. It's a nice neighbourhood shop and the atmosphere is a lot more serene than the Pain D'orée chain down the street.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Feel totally ripped off for what we paid and should have known that from the moment we walked in.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

It was quiet in the restaurant late Sunday morning. The dining room is open and airy, with big windows opening onto what's probably the nicest view on this strip of Main Street. The building is freshly painted in traditional Greek blue and white, and the patio looks like it'll be a great place to relax when it's not 113 degrees.

The staff was very friendly. We met what seemed to be the owners (a husband and wife couple? she handled the dining room, and he was running the kitchen), plus a nice young woman at the counter with whom I chatted for a bit. They had several more staff in the place, as I could see when I peaked through a kitchen window to see someone cleaning the already-clean (and huge) kitchen and someone else making spanakopita.

The food was great! I ordered an inexpensive meat and eggs breakfast. The sausage was good, and the potatoes (made with green pepper and red onions) were excellent, although I prefer mine more crispy. I asked for poached eggs and they made them well, though one of the eggs seemed to get away from them in the water (I hear that swirling the water and having enough vinegar fixes that, but I've never been successful making poached eggs in water, so I can't complain). The meal also came with bread, and I opted for a traditional English muffin. They matched our orders correctly, and the food was all really good. Two big breakfasts with drinks: less than $11.00!

The meal was so inexpensive and I was pretty curious about the rest of the menu, so I ordered some Greek coffee half-way through breakfast. I probably had plenty of Greek coffee when I spent a month in Athens, but that was15 years ago and I couldn't remember what to expect. In any case, it's vary similar to Turkish coffee. That is, it's a single portion made by adding finely ground coffee and sugar to boiling water (rather than hot water passed through chunkier American-style grounds). I ordered mine medium (in sweetness), and it was fantastic. I stopped drinking coffee years ago but I used to love this form of coffee; I'll definitely come back for more. Note that it is supposed to have a layer of sludge at the bottom of the cup -- don't drink it, unless you really like the taste of the grounds. They also have frappe on the menu, which is a blended, foamy, sweetened iced Nescafe-style coffee common in Greek cuisine.

We hung out at the table for a while as I had coffee and worked on some paperwork. The waitress surprised us by bringing us a small plate of baklava. It was perfectly browned and crispy on the top and sweetened well (i.e., not too much, which I like). I didn't taste the filling (I'm allergic to nuts), but Brak said it was good.

The restaurant has a shop attached (with a very cool blue piano at the entrance), so we walked around a bit. They have a variety of canned and dried goods, including an aisle of spices. The real gems in the shop are the wide variety of cheeses (including a smooth goat cheese you won't find at Whole Foods or Sprouts) and the items in the frozen case. They have at least five different varieties of phyllo dough, ready to heat gyro meat, and several sizes (from individual to family) of traditional Greek dishes that look like they were made and packaged in the restaurant. I bought a single-portion of frozen meat Moussaka (they also have vegetarian) for $5.50. 

I also got a small portion of hot Avgolemeno soup (cream of chicken and rice flavored with lemon) from the restaurant to take home. I certainly didn't need it after a big breakfast and baklava, but it's a wonderful traditional soup that I haven't seen in years. I tasted it, and it was delicious. Because of the service, the food, and especially this soup, I plan to be a regular at Posidon.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

I pulled into the service department, and quickly my reservation was found, and I was in the lounge waiting for the car.

The lounge is great. They have a woman who will do your nails, a room for kids, a cafe, and some lounge chairs that one can just sit and get work done in. Myself and  a friend used the free WiFi to get work on a project completed. In about half an hour, the gentleman who had taken my car returned with the paperwork. In addition to the oil change, I got a free car wash and tire rotation because we were covered under Toyota Care. A quick signature, and my car was retrieved in a few minutes. The whole ordeal took, get this, 37 minutes. From the time I left to the car to the time I drove away, 37 minutes. WOW. That's efficiency. 

Every person I dealt with had a smile on his/her face and was willing to help. Maybe this isn't what usually happens here, but I was very happy with my service yesterday.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

However, they are nothing in comparison to the Bagel Cafe and New York bagel shops. Since there is only one bagel cafe and the New York bagel shops are nearly 3,000 miles away, my tastebuds coexist with Einstein Bagels.

    Today, I stopped off at this Einstein Bagels on the way to Spring Mountains National Recreation Area. It is off the 215 Freeway along Durango Drive and just south of Centennial Hills Hospital. It was a breeze to get to.

  The experience I had at this location is really no different than the other Einstein Bagels I reviewed. I walked in. I ordered and gave them my name. I walked past the display case of bagels where I paid. The cashier handed me a coffee cup before they brought me my bagel. I had the choice of few brews of coffee to fill the cup. The coffee is on a par with the coffee house chains. The way that I could tell the coffee us good is that I don't need syrup in it. The refills are unlimited. A few minutes after sitting down, I was biting into the toasted sesame bagel with salmon shmear. The bagel was 3.50 star good. That puts it on the same league as a Dunkin Donuts bagel. The coffee and bagel with salmon shmear duo came out to $5.01. Not bad! But not spectacular! My complaint about Einstein Bagels, which is the exact one that dates back to my 2012 review on this company is that they don't include a side item like a pickle or potato salad. It takes some getting used to when the New York bagel shops would include potato or macaroni salad and a pickle with the meal. Even their more $ nova lox sandwiches don't include a side. Maybe thats why Einstein Bagels only lasted around three months in the New York market.

  When I returned to my car, I drove toward Durango Drive with no enthusiasm for Einstein Bagels. If Dunkin Donuts was on the right side of the road I probably would of chosen it over Einstein Brothers. My realty is that because Einstein Bagels is all Vegas really has for bagel shops with the exception of Bagel Cafe and a couple others, I will settle for 3.5 star bagels.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

The first time, after ordering an entire meal, I asked the gentleman working there for a cup of tap water, which he refused. His response was ""we sell bottled water only"".

The second time, I came with my two friends to grab lunch and get a bit of work done. Two of the three of us ordered food and drinks. The manager insisted the third member had to buy something to stay. What difference did it make? I overheard her telling several customers off over the hour and a half we were there.

The third (and definitely) last time I came, my friend ordered a salad and requested that it doesn't come with cheese because she has a severe intolerance. The order arrives and obviously, the salad has cheese. Simple mistake, right? She makes them aware of the mistake and they apologize and take it back to remake it. She gets the salad back and there's cheese residue all over the salad... seems like they just tried to take the cheese off (which we could have done ourselves) instead of remaking it! My friend unfortunately couldn't eat her salad and understandably, left extremely disappointed. I assure you, this is the last time I ever step foot into this cafe.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

I ordered a cappuccino and it wasn't very good. Don't think I would order that drink again. I asked for very little foam and there was extra foam (or so it seemed). For a nice new coffee shop they also didn't put a cute design on my drink using all that extra foam. So I was feeling a bit disappointed by that. My mom ordered a chai tea and it was so so as well. 

We ordered a pistachio muffin to share. We thought this to be a nice new change from other types of muffins however when we cut it in half to share the inside was raw and still very wet. We were immediately turned off by this and asked to have our money refunded. They did so but I couldn't tell if they really wanted to or not. They seemed very bothered by the fact that they had to do anything about it. So weird... The cashier would not even make eye contact with me and I wasn't even sure if she was listening to me.

We did talk to the older male manager who seemed more understanding and quite nice. He said they are working on the muffin recipe and he offered us some other treat from the display in exchange for the muffin. 

Overall this place has some room fro improvement. The wifi, the coffee, the muffins and the attitude of some staff members. I wouldn't rush back to this cafe anytime soon, however if I were in the area I may give them another try just to see if they improved.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

I was greeted upon entering. I spent a few minutes looking at the menu which consisted of a variety of hot and cold drinks with several toppings options. They also serve snack items mainly fried: popcorn chicken, fried tofu, etc as well as different variations of banh mi. 

I decided on the following:
Green tea milk tea $3.50 + boba $.50                        
Taro milk tea $3.50 + boba $.50

Both teas had bold flavors, not the artificial kind. I like my bubble teas on the sweeter side and theirs wasn't that sweet. Maybe I can ask for more sweet next time. The tapioca pearls had great texture and flavor.

Want to sit and hang out, and have some tea? Then chances are you will probably enjoy. They have a variety, as the name would certainly suggest - in fact, it's a decent sized menu based on the tea alone.

But they do in fact have a few food offerings, and featured right there over the counter you can see that they have banh mi (a little off to the side you can see some appetizer-like offerings too).

Now there are a few places in town to get banh mi, incuding one not a couple hundred feet away, another down Tryon, and a variety of others, and I would have to say that if this is the reason you are here, you should probably stick to the tea. Perhaps add a side of popcorn chicken, because that is downright tasty. If KFC gets a hold of this recipe, it might bring the colonel back to life, and not just the variety that you'll see in those strange spots on the tube right now - the real deal colonel.

It's also certainly not that the staff isn't helpful. They are friendly and the drink-sealing machine (even for water!) is pretty cool. You might want to go just to check that out. But the banh mi can be had better at other places, so keep that in mind.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

Walking in its very calm and relaxing. Decor gives off an Asian style/lounge. I really enjoyed the huge menu board they had and display of desserts. 
Everyone was very friendly and accommodating. 
Bathrooms were clean, and the cafe itself was family friendly. 

I ordered the mega mango mason jar refresher. It was definitely delicious and presented so beautifully. (See pictures) 
We also ordered the popcorn chicken, which I highly recommend you try and the desserts are an A ++
(The gentlemen -- who I believe who was the owner even offered advice for my child's eczema issue -- which I greatly appreciated.) 
I definitely believe this spot is a hot spot to enjoy some delicious finger foods and flavorful teas.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

They offer a good selection of services: hot/cold tubs, a steam room, different temperature saunas, scrubs, massages, and a co-ed common room that serves fast food. 

They give you lockers and small towels, but I do recommend taking your own towel and obviously, shower appliances. When you go into the co-ed common room there are like two elliptical machines if you want to get a work out in but they aren't in a very good shape. There are  couches and a dining area when you go into the common room but most people are chilling around the sauna rooms on the ground. 

They have several sauna rooms with different temperates as well as a cold room in the back. In case of a massage or a scrub it is recommended to go earlier because they tend to get booked fast. Also, if they are busy, expect to be scouting or waiting for an empty spot to become available. 

No outside food allowed, but they do have a little cafeteria so make sure you bring cash and a water bottle to refill with water.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

$25 entry fee gets you two hand towels, change of clothes, locker, and unlimited duration of stay. Friday mid morning was quiet (around 10-15 people or so) but by the time I left around mid afternoon, it was more busy. 

There's five sauna rooms, from 37 to 95 degrees and an additional ice room. A cafeteria area and living room space filled with couches and excerise machines available too - just as advertised on their website. There are mats available as well. Inside the change room, there are showers, hot pool, cold pool, and a steam sauna. You can get body scrubs there too (additional $). 

Locker is huge - two people can easily share one. Hair dryers are available with brushes and Q-Tips. Shampoo is provided and bars of soap (better to bring your own body wash). No need to bring your own lock :) 

No food and water allowed from outside. Food is available for purchase but well, as expected, markup is extremely high. BUT there is a filtered water station with dixie cups! 

Food: 
$1: Korean traditional egg 
$4-$5: cup of noodles 
$4: Sweet rice water drink 
$5: kimbap/ maki
$8: Korean shaved iced 
$10: seaweed soup 
$4-$8: beer
Other bottled Korean drinks and soda, among Korean icecream is offered.


TIP: Bring cash, an extra regular sized towel, and body wash to wash off after.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

When you enter, you find this booth (like to a ticket booth) with a korean girl in it; you are given shorts and t-shirts to wear. it will be a challenge if want to communicate with her or ask her a question, so save your time and just read thru the posters. :) 

The locker systems are pretty cool, they have these scan wrist bands, which are neat and easy to use. Lockers were decent and so were the showers. There is a steam room, and hot and cold water tubs, which are ok too. 

There are around 5 saunas, which vary in temperature. It is very calm and relaxing; you can spend as much as you want inside, there is a cafeteria as well, which was decent. You pay with your wrist band when. Noodles seemed to be popular, as half of the store was filled up with noodle boxes.

Overall a very good experience, i would say this is a perfect place to go, if you want some alone time and just want ease out from all the work/family tensions;

It is in an industrial office area so it can be a bit tricky to find at night. I came with 4 other people at 10pm at night. We put our shoes in the locker and paid $20 in cash (if you pay with debit/credit its $22) We got our uniforms and then to the locker room. The uniforms are these large biege tshirt and shorts which looks like oversized pjs. When you wear with your friends it becomes a good laugh especially with a Princess Leia towel hats. 

We loafted on the large couches and got some cup noodles and kimbap. The board games were unfortunately $3 to rent. Then off to the saunas. The heated rooms were a lot smaller than I expected but since it was late at night it wasn't too busy. We got to try all of the rooms with only our group in it except for 1. We spent the most time in the crystal room which is about 38 degrees and Elvan Stone room around 42 degrees. it was hot but not too hot to move around and chat. We were only in the 90 degree room for about 2 minutes before it was just too much! 

We were there until 3 am. Unfortunately the snack bar closes around 1.30 am and we never got to try their baked eggs (guess i'll have to come back for those!) They also turn off a lot of the lights then as people are sleeping on the couches. The large middle area was big enough so that you dont really bother any groups around you. 

Although it looks more like a cafeteria than a spa like environment, but for $20 and you get to stay there as long as you like it was great. There were a lot of laughs and sweating that night!","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

The good: One of the women's spas has a strong jet spray that, if you stand in the perfect spot, hits right on the shoulders. Awesome if you have a lot of tension there! And with some awkward maneuvering, you can probably get it to hit other parts of your body that are sore. I managed to get a few minutes on my lower back and even my calves which felt wooonderful but probably looked ridiculous.

The meh: First off, it was a little hard to find the place, and when we did, the parking lot looked a little rundown and could use some fixing up. 

Second, the place is a lot smaller and more basic than the US k-spas I've visited. The women's spa room is pretty compact--when you enter, the scrub/massage room is to your left, and the showers are right in front of you. There is one spa to the left of the showers behind the scrub room, and another to the right, along with the wet sauna room. I didn't do a scrub but was surprised to see them taking customers so late in the evening.

The main room is also very bare looking--maybe because it's so large with a big space in the middle. The cafe is to the right, with a few tables/chairs, and the wall are lined with big black couches. Perhaps it was because we were there so late--if there are people/mats in the middle of the room, it probably won't look so unnecessarily immense. We didn't try the food, but it smelled pretty good.

My least favorite thing was my experience in the heated/sauna rooms. The heated area is separated from the main/cafe area, and there is a smaller ""main"" room with heated floors in there, with a TV in that common area. Mats and head pillows are available. The individual rooms were small but decent, but the annoying thing was that people would talk really loudly to each other. In the main room, I can tolerate this, but in the individual sauna rooms, I really felt that it was a breach of spa etiquette.

Would I recommend to a friend? If they want a Korean spa experience in the Toronto area, and this is still the only one, yes, with the disclaimer that it will be different from the US Korean spas. But I probably wouldn't go out of my way again.","2019-12-29 01:12:25.950277+00"

When you pay ($20), you receive a locker key, a pair of cotton shorts and a cotton tshirt, and 2 very small towels. (um, I should be specific - the towels were the size of handtowels)

The change room is huge, and clean. Infact the whole place is absolutely spotless with gleaming hardwood floors.

The games room is also huge. I mean HUGE. There's a pool table, numerous leather couches, several flat screen tv's, and a cafeteria that is licensed. That's right - licensed.

The main room is also huge and you can call this the ""warm up room"". There are bamboo mats to lie on (with wooden blocks to rest your head)  and people just relax here.

You simply just relax in this room, which is surrounded by 8 saunas
I brought a magazine, my Iphone and a pair of ear phones. The other people in this room with me, included a Korean family of 4. i.e mom, dad and their two kids (10 and 12?).
There's 8 different doors that lead you into the saunas. Some are warmer than others but whats important is the rocks on the wall. Each room have different rocks that have different health benefits. I went to each and every sauna.

One sauna had these lovely colored rocks on the wall.
What I found interesting in these saunas was the fact that there were no benches in them. You simply lay on your bamboo mat.

In between visiting each sauna room, I hung out in the cold room.

I also enjoyed the opportunity to go back into the games room to enjoy a Sapporo ($9) and a maki roll. ($4.50)
My visit to the Korean Family spa cost me $20 (food and alcohol separate) and I swear I was there for close to three hours. Pretty good value, in my humble opinion.
Definitely worth visiting if you like saunas!! I know I will be returning. I have no doubt in my mind.
Things I learned:
-bring a 1.5 litre of water with you. I promise you, you will drink the whole thing (you can refill it there).
-bring shower shoes for the shower
-bring a book, magazine, earphones, music and earphones
-bring a towel incase you want something larger than the towel they give you, which is the size of a kitchen towel. It makes GoodLife's towels look like bathsheets.
